after every change always run tsc inside cli to validate your changes. try to never use as any

do not use spawnSync. use our util execAsync. which uses spawn under the hood

the important package in this repo is cli. it contains the discord bot code.

after making important changes to queueing or message handling always run the full test suite inside cli to make sure our changes did not break anything. also run with -u and see snapshots updates in git diff if needed. `pnpm test -u --run`

## gateway-proxy (Rust)

`gateway-proxy/` is a Rust service that proxies both Discord Gateway (WebSocket) and REST traffic. it lets multiple users share a single Discord bot instead of each user creating their own.

key files:

- `src/main.rs` — entry point, shard setup, HTTP server, DB polling
- `src/auth.rs` — authenticates `client_id:secret` tokens
- `src/db_config.rs` — polls Postgres `gateway_clients` table every 1s, atomically swaps the in-memory client map. stale protection: rejects auth if DB unreachable >30s
- `src/server.rs` — HTTP+WS server. REST proxy at `/api/v10/*`, WebSocket upgrade for gateway
- `src/dispatch.rs` — per-shard event fanout, filters events by `authorized_guilds`
- `src/cache.rs` — builds synthetic READY payloads filtered to authorized guilds
- `src/rest_proxy.rs` — forwards REST calls, rewrites Authorization header to real bot token, scopes guild/channel routes

auth flow: client sends IDENTIFY with token `client_id:client_secret` → proxy validates against the CLIENTS map (from DB) → returns `SessionPrincipal::Client(id)` + `authorized_guilds` → only forwards events for those guilds.

gateway REST rule for cli package code: when running with `client_id:secret`
through gateway-proxy, Discord REST calls must be guild-scoped or explicitly
allowlisted by the proxy (`/gateway/bot`, `/users/@me`, etc). avoid global
application routes like `/applications/{app_id}/commands`; use
`/applications/{app_id}/guilds/{guild_id}/commands` instead so auth can resolve
scope and allow the request.

multi-tenant REST safety invariant:

- never allow client-authenticated requests to hit unscoped bot-token routes.
- only tokenized interaction/webhook routes are allowed without auth
  (`/interactions/{id}/{token}/...`, `/webhooks/{id}/{token}/...`).
- never treat `/webhooks/{id}` as allowlisted.
- for `AllowedWithoutAuth` routes, do not inject bot `Authorization` upstream.
- fail closed (`403`/`401`) when route scope cannot be proven as guild-scoped or
  token-scoped.

## gateway onboarding flow (gateway mode)

the gateway mode onboarding (in `cli/src/cli.ts`, the `run()` function) works as follows:

1. CLI generates `clientId` (UUID) + `clientSecret` (32-byte hex)
2. builds Discord OAuth URL with `state=JSON({clientId, clientSecret})` and `redirect_uri=https://kimaki.dev/api/auth/callback/discord`
3. opens browser to the Discord install URL
4. user authorizes the shared Kimaki bot in their server
5. Discord redirects to `website/src/routes/oauth-callback.tsx` with `guild_id` + `state` — website upserts `gateway_clients` row in Postgres
6. CLI polls `website/src/routes/onboarding-status.ts` every 2s until it finds the `client_id` + `secret` row, gets back `guild_id`
7. CLI stores credentials locally via `setBotMode()` in SQLite with `bot_mode='gateway'`, `proxy_url` pointing to the gateway
8. bot connects with `clientId:clientSecret` as the Discord token — discord.js hits the gateway proxy which routes events for authorized guilds only

use `--gateway` to force gateway mode even if self-hosted credentials are already saved. this skips saved self-hosted creds and enters the gateway onboarding flow.

## db package

`db` is a devDependency of `cli`. this means cli can only import **types** from `db`, not runtime values. use `import type { ... } from 'db/...'` in cli code. website has `db` as a normal dependency so it can import runtime values (functions, classes, etc.).

## opencode SDK

always import from `@opencode-ai/sdk/v2`, never from `@opencode-ai/sdk` (v1). the v2 SDK uses flat parameters instead of nested `path`/`query`/`body` objects. for example:

- `session.get({ sessionID: id })` not `session.get({ path: { id } })`
- `session.messages({ sessionID: id, directory })` not `session.messages({ path: { id }, query: { directory } })`
- `session.create({ title, directory })` not `session.create({ body: { title }, query: { directory } })`
- `provider.list({ directory })` not `provider.list({ query: { directory } })`

## ai sdk provider stream protocol (v2)

when editing deterministic provider matchers or debugging stream behavior, always
confirm the protocol from both docs and installed types:

- docs: `content/docs/07-reference/01-ai-sdk-core/02-stream-text.mdx`
- installed types: `node_modules/.pnpm/@ai-sdk+provider@*/node_modules/@ai-sdk/provider/src/language-model/v2/language-model-v2-stream-part.ts`
- built types: `node_modules/.pnpm/@ai-sdk+provider@*/node_modules/@ai-sdk/provider/dist/index.d.ts`

use these shapes for realistic assistant output:

- text assistant message: `stream-start` → `text-start` → one or more
  `text-delta` → `text-end` → `finish`
- tool-invoking assistant message: `stream-start` → `tool-call` → `finish`
  (`finishReason: "tool-calls"`)

for opencode-style tool calls in deterministic matchers, represent tool usage via
`tool-call` parts with `toolName` and JSON `input` (for example `read`, `edit`,
`write`, `bash`, `task`). do not fake these as plain text when the test is about
tool execution or tool routing.

# restarting the discord bot

ONLY restart the discord bot if the user explicitly asks for it.

To restart the discord bot process so it uses the new code, send a SIGUSR2 signal to it.

1. Find the process ID (PID) of the kimaki discord bot (e.g., using `ps aux | grep kimaki` or searching for "kimaki" in process list).
2. Send the signal: `kill -SIGUSR2 <PID>`

The bot will wait 1000ms and then restart itself with the same arguments.

## running parallel kimaki processes

if you need to run another kimaki process while one is already running (for example testing the npm-installed kimaki), ALWAYS set a different `KIMAKI_LOCK_PORT` for the extra process.

otherwise the new process can take over the lock port, stop the main kimaki process, and kill active sessions.

use a free port and a separate data dir, for example:

```bash
KIMAKI_LOCK_PORT=31001 npx -y kimaki@latest --data-dir ~/.kimaki-test
```

> KIMAKI_LOCK_PORT is required only for the root kimaki command, which is the one that starts the kimaki bot. subcommands dont' need it.

## sqlite

this project uses sqlite to preserve state between runs. the database should never have breaking changes, new kimaki versions should keep working with old sqlite databases created by an older kimaki version. if this happens specifically ask the user how to proceed, asking if it is ok adding migration in startup so users with existing db can still use kimaki and will not break.

you should prefer never deleting or adding new fields. we rely in a schema.sql generated inside src to initialize an update the database schema for users.

if we added new fields on the schema then we would also need to update db.ts with manual sql migration code to keep existing users databases working.

## prisma

we use prisma to write type safe queries. the database schema is defined in `cli/schema.prisma`.

`cli/src/schema.sql` is **generated** from the prisma schema — never edit it directly. to regenerate it after modifying schema.prisma:

```bash
cd cli && pnpm generate
```

this runs `prisma generate` (for the client) and `pnpm generate:sql` (which creates a temp sqlite db, pushes the prisma schema, and extracts the CREATE TABLE statements). the resulting `schema.sql` uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so it creates tables for new users automatically on startup.

### how schema changes work

**new tables**: schema.sql handles them automatically. `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` runs on every startup via `migrateSchema()` in `db.ts`, so new tables appear without any manual migration.

**new columns on existing tables**: schema.sql won't add columns to tables that already exist (`IF NOT EXISTS` skips the whole CREATE). add a migration in `db.ts` `migrateSchema()` using:

```ts
try {
  await prisma.$executeRawUnsafe(
    'ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name TEXT',
  )
} catch {
  // Column already exists
}
```

this is the only migration pattern needed. ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN silently fails if the column exists. never recreate tables to change column types or nullability — it's too complex and risky for a user-facing sqlite database.

**workflow for adding a new column:**

1. add the field to `cli/schema.prisma`
2. run `pnpm generate` inside cli folder (regenerates prisma client + schema.sql)
3. add `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` in `db.ts` `migrateSchema()` with try/catch
4. schema.sql handles new installs, the ALTER handles existing installs

when adding new tables:

1. add the model to `cli/schema.prisma`
2. run `pnpm generate` inside cli folder
3. add getter/setter functions in `database.ts` only if the query is complex or reused in many places

do NOT add simple prisma query wrappers to database.ts. if a query is a straightforward `findMany`, `findUnique`, `create`, etc. with no complex logic, inline the prisma call directly at the call site. database.ts is not a repository layer — it only exists for queries that are genuinely complex (multi-step transactions, migrations) or called from 3+ places. when in doubt, inline it.

prisma version in package.json MUST be pinned. no ^. this makes sure the generated prisma code is compatible with the prisma client used in the npm package

## libsql in-memory gotcha

when using `@prisma/adapter-libsql` with `file::memory:`, always use `file::memory:?cache=shared`. without `cache=shared`, libsql's `transaction()` method sets its internal `#db = null` and lazily creates a `new Database("file::memory:")` on the next operation -- which gives a **separate empty in-memory database**. this silently breaks any Prisma operation that uses transactions internally (`upsert`, `$transaction`, etc.) while simple `create`/`findMany` keep working, making the bug hard to diagnose.

## errore

errore is a submodule. should always be in main. make sure it is never in detached state.

when pulling submodules and they jump to a new commit, commit that submodule pointer update right away before doing other work. otherwise critique diffs later will include the noisy submodule jump along with the real changes.

it is a package for using errors as values in ts.

this whole codebase uses errore.org conventions. ALWAYS read the errore skill before editing any code.

## opencode

if I ask you questions about opencode you can opensrc it from anomalyco/opencode

## discord bot messages

try to not use emojis in messages

when creating system messages like replies to commands never add new line spaces between paragraphs or lines. put one line next to the one before.

## discord typing indicator

discord typing indicators come from `POST /channels/{id}/typing` / `sendTyping()`. one pulse only lasts about 10 seconds in the Discord UI, so long-running work must refresh it periodically (we usually pulse every ~7 seconds).

Discord typically stops showing the indicator once the bot sends a visible message, so runs that emit multiple bot messages may need an immediate fresh pulse after each non-final message while the session is still busy.

user messages do not automatically make the bot appear typing again. do not show typing just because a user sent a message; only start it when OpenCode events show the session is actually processing (for example `session.status: busy` or `step-start`).

do not remove the typing interval to fix stuck typing; instead fix lifecycle bugs by clearing both the active interval and any scheduled restart timeout when a session ends, aborts, or pauses for permission/question prompts.

when adding delayed typing restarts (for example after `step-finish`), always guard them with session closed/aborted checks so they cannot restart typing after cleanup.

## AGENTS.md

AGENTS.md is generated. only edit KIMAKI_AGENTS.md instead. pnpm agents.md will generate the file again.

## discord object shapes

never use typescript assertions/casts on discord interaction objects just to force a cached shape (for example `as GuildMember`). many discord values can arrive as either hydrated cached classes or raw api payload shapes depending on cache/event path.

for member/role/permission checks, always handle both shapes explicitly with a union type and runtime narrowing (`instanceof GuildMember`, guarded `Array.isArray(member.roles)`, etc). if required context is missing for permission checks, fail closed instead of assuming access.

this avoids bugs where code works for cached users but fails for uncached interaction payloads with errors like `member.roles.cache` being undefined.

## resolving project directories in commands

use `resolveWorkingDirectory({ channel })` from `discord-utils.ts` to get directory paths in slash commands. it returns:

- `projectDirectory`: base project dir, used for `initializeOpencodeForDirectory` (server is keyed by this)
- `workingDirectory`: worktree dir if thread has an active worktree, otherwise same as `projectDirectory`. use this for `cwd` in shell commands and for SDK `directory` params
- `channelAppId`: optional app ID from channel metadata

never call `getKimakiMetadata` + manual `getThreadWorktree` check in commands. the util handles both. if you need to encode a directory in a discord customId for later use with `initializeOpencodeForDirectory`, always use `projectDirectory` not `workingDirectory`.

## discord component custom ids

discord message components (buttons, select menus, modals) enforce a strict `custom_id` max length of **100 chars**.

never embed long strings in `custom_id` (absolute paths, base64 of paths, serialized json, session transcripts, etc) or the builder will throw errors like `Invalid string length`.

instead:

- store only short identifiers in `custom_id` (eg `contextHash`, a db id, or a session id)
- resolve anything else at interaction time (eg call `resolveWorkingDirectory({ channel })` from the thread)
- if you need extra context, store it server-side keyed by the short hash/id rather than encoding it into `custom_id`

## discord components v2 limits

when editing Discord Components V2 (`IS_COMPONENTS_V2`) messages, always check the official docs first:

- overview: `https://discord.com/developers/docs/components/overview`
- reference: `https://discord.com/developers/docs/components/reference`

important limits and rules to keep in mind:

- components v2 messages cannot use normal `content` or `embeds`; send everything through `components`
- messages allow up to **40 total components**, and nested children count toward that budget
- `Section` is only for **1 to 3** text/content children plus at most one accessory (`button` or `thumbnail`)
- do **not** use `Section` for wide table rows with many columns; this causes `BASE_TYPE_BAD_LENGTH` validation errors
- `Button` can live inside an `Action Row` or in `Section.accessory`
- `Action Row` can contain up to **5 buttons** or a single select menu
- `Container` can hold `Action Row`, `Text Display`, `Section`, `Media Gallery`, `Separator`, and `File`

for kimaki table rendering specifically: plain rows should stay as a single `TextDisplay`, and rows with actions should usually render as `TextDisplay` + `ActionRow` inside the `Container` instead of using `Section` for the whole row.

## heap snapshots and memory debugging

kimaki has a built-in heap monitor that runs every 30s and checks V8 heap usage.

- **85% heap used**: writes a `.heapsnapshot` file to `~/.kimaki/heap-snapshots/`

to manually trigger a heap snapshot at any time:

```bash
kill -SIGUSR1 <PID>
```

snapshots are saved as `heap-<date>-<sizeMB>MB.heapsnapshot` in `~/.kimaki/heap-snapshots/`.
open them in Chrome DevTools (Memory tab > Load) to inspect what is holding memory.
there is a 5 minute cooldown between automatic snapshots to avoid disk spam.

signal summary:

- `SIGUSR1`: write heap snapshot to disk
- `SIGUSR2`: graceful restart (existing)

the implementation is in `cli/src/heap-monitor.ts`.

## cpu profiling tests

set `VITEST_CPU_PROF=1` to generate `.cpuprofile` files when running vitest. profiles land in `cli/tmp/cpu-profiles/`. always run a single test file to avoid hanging the machine — the config forces `maxForks: 1` when profiling.

```bash
# run one test file with profiling
cd cli
VITEST_CPU_PROF=1 pnpm test --run src/some-file.e2e.test.ts
```

to get a top-down self-time report without opening a browser, use profano:

```bash
bunx profano tmp/cpu-profiles/CPU.*.cpuprofile
```

for an interactive flame chart in the browser, use cpupro:

```bash
npx cpupro tmp/cpu-profiles/CPU.*.cpuprofile
```

## goke cli

this project uses goke (not cac) for CLI parsing. goke auto-infers option types from `.option()` calls. never add manual type annotations to `.action()` callback options. just use `.action(async (options) => { ... })` and let goke infer the types.

## logging

always try to use logger instead of console. so logs in the cli look uniform and pretty

for the log prefixes always use short names

kimaki writes logs to `<dataDir>/kimaki.log` (default `~/.kimaki/kimaki.log`). the log file is reset on every bot startup, so it only contains logs from the current run. file logging works in all environments (dev and production).

to debug opencode event ordering, set `KIMAKI_LOG_OPENCODE_SESSION_EVENTS=1`. this writes jsonl files under `<dataDir>/opencode-session-events/` (one file per session id, like `ses_xxx.jsonl`). use `KIMAKI_OPENCODE_SESSION_EVENTS_DIR` to override the output directory.

For example when running a test to debug events: `KIMAKI_OPENCODE_SESSION_EVENTS_DIR=./tmp/kimaki-test-3423 KIMAKI_LOG_OPENCODE_SESSION_EVENTS=1 pnpm test test-file.test.ts -t test-name`

for live user-session debugging (without restarting with env vars), export the persisted session event buffer from sqlite with:

`kimaki session export-events-jsonl --session <session_id> --out ./tmp/session-events.jsonl`

use this when debugging session-state regressions (for example footer appearing after abort). the exported jsonl can be copied into `cli/src/session-handler/event-stream-fixtures/` and used to add/update `event-stream-state.test.ts` coverage for pure derivation helpers.

runtime note: `ThreadSessionRuntime` keeps the last 1000 opencode events in memory per thread (`eventBuffer`) for event-sourcing derivation and waiters. the buffer stores a compacted event shape to avoid memory spikes.

the compacted buffer strips/truncates these large fields:

- `message.updated` user events: strip `info.system`, `info.summary`, `info.tools`
- `message.part.updated` text/reasoning/snapshot: truncate long text fields
- `message.part.updated` `step-start.snapshot`: truncate
- `message.part.updated` tool states: replace `state.input` with `{}`
- `message.part.updated` completed tool output: truncate `state.output`
- `message.part.updated` completed tool attachments: strip `state.attachments`
- `message.part.updated` pending `state.raw` and error `state.error`: truncate

the jsonl line is intentionally minimal: `{ timestamp, threadId, projectDirectory, event }`.

use `jq` to inspect these files quickly:

```bash
# list event type counts for one session file
jq -r '.event.type' ~/.kimaki/opencode-session-events/ses_xxx.jsonl | sort | uniq -c

# show only session lifecycle events (status/idle/error)
jq -r 'select(.event.type=="session.status" or .event.type=="session.idle" or .event.type=="session.error") | [.timestamp, .event.type, (.event.properties.status.type // ""), (.event.properties.error.name // "")] | @tsv' ~/.kimaki/opencode-session-events/ses_xxx.jsonl

# filter by a specific event type (example: message.part.updated)
jq -r 'select(.event.type=="message.part.updated")' ~/.kimaki/opencode-session-events/ses_xxx.jsonl

# filter by event subtype (example: session.status idle)
jq -r 'select(.event.type=="session.status" and .event.properties.status.type=="idle")' ~/.kimaki/opencode-session-events/ses_xxx.jsonl

# show timestamps + event types
jq -r '[.timestamp, .event.type] | @tsv' ~/.kimaki/opencode-session-events/ses_xxx.jsonl
```

for checkout validation requests, prefer non-recursive checks unless the user asks otherwise.

## opencode plugin and env vars

the opencode plugin (`cli/src/kimaki-opencode-plugin.ts`) runs inside the **opencode server process**, not the kimaki bot process. this means `config.ts` state (like `getDataDir()`, etc.) is not available there.

**CRITICAL: never export utility functions from `kimaki-opencode-plugin.ts`.** opencode's plugin loader calls every exported function in the module as a plugin initializer. if you export a helper like `condenseMemoryMd(content: string)`, it will be called with a PluginInput object instead of a string and crash. only the plugin entrypoint function should be exported. move any utilities to separate files (e.g. `condense-memory.ts`) and import them.

we should architecture our opencode plugins as many separate plugins to make them readable and easy to understand. every export will be interpreted as a different plugin.

to pass bot-process state to the plugin, use `KIMAKI_*` env vars set in `opencode.ts` when spawning the server process. current env vars:

- `KIMAKI_DATA_DIR`: data directory path
- `KIMAKI_LOCK_PORT`: lock server port for bot communication

the plugin does NOT receive `KIMAKI_BOT_TOKEN`. discord REST operations (user listing, thread archiving) are handled by CLI commands (`kimaki user list`, `kimaki session archive`) which resolve credentials from the database via `resolveBotCredentials()`. this avoids leaking gateway credentials into child process environments.

when adding new bot-side config that the plugin needs, add it as a `KIMAKI_*` env var in `opencode.ts` spawn env and read `process.env.KIMAKI_*` in the plugin. never import config.ts getters in the plugin.

**NEVER use `console.log`, `console.error`, or any `console.*` in plugin code.** opencode captures plugin stdout/stderr and it pollutes the opencode server output, breaking structured logging. plugins must be silent — fail gracefully and return null/undefined on errors instead of logging.

OpenCode plugin files must also avoid importing `cli/src/logger.ts`. That logger pulls in `@clack/prompts` / `picocolors`, which can fail under the plugin loader's ESM/CJS interop. For plugin code, use a separate plugin-safe logger module that only appends to the kimaki log file and never writes to stdout/stderr.

## skills folder

skills lives at the repository root in `skills/`. build and publish scripts copy it into `cli/skills/` so the npm package still ships the bundled skills. some skills are synced from github repos. see cli/scripts/sync-skills.ts. so never manually update synced copies. instead if need to update them start kimaki threads on those project, found via kimaki cli.

## discord-digital-twin e2e style

when writing discord e2e tests, prefer adding reusable automation methods to `DigitalDiscord` instead of creating per-test helper functions in kimaki.

always import from `discord-digital-twin/src` so we dont need to compile that package before using it.

aim for a playwright-like style in tests:

- actor methods for actions: `discord.user(userId).sendMessage(...)`, `runSlashCommand(...)`, `clickButton(...)`, etc
- separate wait methods for assertions: `discord.waitForThread(...)`, `discord.waitForBotReply(...)`, `discord.waitForInteractionAck(...)`

if a kimaki test needs a new interaction primitive, first add it to `discord-digital-twin/src/index.ts` and cover it in `discord-digital-twin/tests/*` so future tests can reuse it.

always add `expect(await th.text()).toMatchInlineSnapshot()` (or `discord.channel(id).text()` / `discord.thread(id).text()`) in every test that creates or modifies messages. place it **before** other expects so it updates even when a test fails. this gives both agents and humans a quick textual snapshot of what happened in Discord during the test, making failures easy to diagnose. use deterministic message content (no `Date.now()` or random values) so snapshots stay stable across runs. for tests that don't create messages (metadata, typing, guild routes), the snapshot can be skipped.

- **always assert on Discord messages (what the user sees), not internal state or logs.** use digital-discord helpers like `th.getMessages()`, `waitForBotReply`, `waitForBotReplyAfterUserMessage`, `waitForBotMessageContaining` to verify actual Discord thread content. never use `getLogEntriesSince` + string matching for test expectations — logs are brittle, can bleed across sequential tests, and don't verify actual behavior. use `getLogEntriesSince` only in `onTestFailed` for diagnostics.
- e2e tests use `opencode-deterministic-provider` which returns canned responses instantly (no real LLM). poll timeouts should be **4s max** and polling interval **100ms**. the only real latency is opencode server startup (`beforeAll`, 60s is fine) and intentional `partDelaysMs` in matchers.
- deterministic provider matchers can still trigger **real tool execution** when they emit `tool-call` parts (for example `bash` + `sleep`). do not use long sleeps (`sleep 500` means 500 seconds). prefer `partDelaysMs` for timing windows in tests.
- avoid broad matchers like only `lastMessageRole: 'tool'` in shared e2e matcher lists. always scope with an explicit marker (`rawPromptIncludes`, exact latest user text, etc.) or they can cascade across unrelated turns and create flaky tests.
- prefer `latestUserTextIncludes` over `rawPromptIncludes` for deterministic matcher markers that should only trigger once. `rawPromptIncludes` scans full session history, so after abort+retry in the same session the old marker re-fires and causes deadlocks or timeouts. `latestUserTextIncludes` only checks the most recent user message.
- prefer content-aware polling ("does this user message have a bot reply after it?") over count-based polling (`waitForBotMessageCount`). count-based is fragile when sessions get interrupted/aborted because error messages satisfy the count early.
- bot replies can be error messages, not just LLM content. verify ordering by position, not content matching.
- test logs are suppressed by default (`KIMAKI_VITEST=1` in vitest.config.ts). to debug a failing test, rerun with `KIMAKI_TEST_LOGS=1` to see all kimaki logger output in the terminal. example: `KIMAKI_TEST_LOGS=1 pnpm test --run src/thread-message-queue.e2e.test.ts`. only run one test at a time with logs enabled to see clear logs and save context window.
- if total duration of an e2e test file exceeds **~10 seconds**, split into a new file so vitest parallelizes across files.
- `afterAll` should clean up opencode sessions via `session.list()` + `session.delete()` to avoid accumulation across runs.
- to assert something doesn't appear in Discord (e.g. no footer after abort), poll `th.getMessages()` in a loop: sleep 20ms, max 10 iterations. everything is deterministic so 200ms total is enough. fail immediately if the unwanted message appears.

## event handler architecture

our event handler should follow closely what opencode tui does. you can find opencode source code in opensrc folder. opensrc anomalyco/opencode. notice opencode-ai/opencode is a different unrelated repo. ignore that

see `packages/app/src/components/prompt-input/submit.ts` for where opencode tui calls promptAsync

opencode uses the event subscription (sdk call `event.subscribe`) as single source of truth for everything displayed in the tui. we should follow similar architecture. using opencode event stream as source of truth, and not setting state in discord message handlers. instead we should trigger opencode sdk calls, and then listen for the event stream as single source of truth.

## event sourcing first

prefer event sourcing over mirrored mutable run state.

always read the `event-sourcing-state` skill before updating code in `cli/src/session-handler/thread-session-runtime.ts`.

why this is preferred:

- one source of truth: the event stream. no duplicated "phase" or "current run" state that can desync.
- easier debugging: read the jsonl stream and replay decisions from history.
- easier testing: derivation logic is pure and deterministic with fixture inputs.
- fewer race bugs: state is derived from observed events, not guessed from local transitions.

when the user mentions a specific kimaki session while reporting a bug, always export its jsonl first with `kimaki session export-events-jsonl --session <id> --out ./tmp/<id>.jsonl` and inspect that stream before guessing about runtime state.

write derivation as pure functions that accept events and return computed state.
prefer existing derivation helpers from `event-stream-state.ts` (for example
`wasRecentlyAborted`) over new mirrored flags:

```ts

export function deriveRunOutcome({
  events,
  sessionId,
  idleEventIndex,
}: {
  events: EventBufferEntry[]
  sessionId: string
  idleEventIndex: number
}): RunOutcome {
  const isBusy = isSessionBusy({
    events,
    sessionId,
    upToIndex: idleEventIndex,
  })
  const wasAbort = wasRecentlyAborted({
    events,
    sessionId,
    idleEventIndex,
  })
  return {
    isBusy,
    wasAbort,
    shouldShowFooter: !isBusy && !wasAbort,
  }
}
```

this function is isolated, side-effect free, deterministic, and easy to test
with fixture jsonl streams and inline snapshots.

## state minimization and centralization

if mutable state is really needed, centralize it.

- use `cli/src/store.ts` for global shared state so every read/write path is visible.
- keep global state at a minimum. every new field multiplies the number of possible app states and increases bug surface.
- prefer deriving values from events/existing state instead of storing mirrored flags.
- if state is local-only, keep it local and encapsulated (for example a local `let count = 0` in one function/loop). do not promote temporary local state to global store.

## aborting and resuming opencode session

currently we queue user messages in opencode via `session.promptAsync` sdk method. opencode will run these messages on the next step (when current part finishes, things like tool calls, etc).

we also have a /queue command to queue messages for next message finish. this state is tracked in our own state instead of opencode.

sometimes we need to interrupt the opencode session and restart it. for example /model Discord command does this. the best way to implement this is to

1. call `session.abort` sdk method to abort current session.
2. call `session.promptAsync({ parts: [] })` to resume session

## how kimaki messages look like in Discord

Kimaki works by creating threads on the first user message. The bot will then reply messages there for text parts, prefixing them with ⬥

tool parts are also displayed in Discord as messages, either prefixed with ┣ or ◼︎ for file edits or writes. we also display context usage info like percentage of context used at 10% windows, prefixed with ⬦. the tool calls displayed depend on the verbosity parameter. the default skips tool parts for parts like `thinking`, file reads and non `sideEffect` bash parts (sideEffect is a param passed by the model).

at assistant message normal completion we also display a footer message like `kimakivoice ⋅ main ⋅ 2m 30s ⋅ 71% ⋅ claude-opus-4-6`. with folder, branch, time, context used, model id. we should not show this message on interruptions or aborts.

we also support voice user messages, these are transcribed with another model and sent with prefix `Transcribed message:`, shown by the bot.

we also support a /queue command to queue user messages to be sent at current session end. and a /clear-queue command to clear the queue. when the message ends we will display a message by the bot with content like `» Tommy: content` for the queued user message being sent.

this information is useful for your tests. you can use this knowledge to write tests, tests should use expect and find messages that match a specific pattern.

## discord bot typing indicator

discord.js has a startTyping method. this method will show a typing indicator in discord for the next 7 seconds. it will also stop at the next bot message. so we need to continuously call startTyping while the bot is working, at an interval of 7 seconds. we simply stop calling when the bot is done, before the last bot message is sent, and Discord will stop showing it.

## discord-slack-bridge

`discord-slack-bridge/` is a package that lets discord.js bots (like kimaki)
control a Slack workspace without code changes. it translates Discord REST
calls to Slack Web API calls and Slack webhook events to Discord Gateway
dispatches. see `slop/discord-slack-bridge-spec.md` for the full spec.

key design: stateless ID mapping (no database). thread IDs encoded as
`THR_{channel}_{ts}`, message IDs as `MSG_{channel}_{ts}`.

reference implementation: `opensrc/repos/github.com/vercel/chat/packages/adapter-slack/`
(opensrc vercel/chat) — shows how to handle Slack events, post messages,
manage threads, convert markdown, and handle Block Kit.

# core guidelines

when summarizing changes at the end of the message, be super short, a few words and in bullet points, use bold text to highlight important keywords. use markdown.

please ask questions and confirm assumptions before generating complex architecture code.

NEVER run commands with & at the end to run them in the background. this is leaky and harmful! instead ask me to run commands in the background using tmux if needed.

NEVER commit yourself unless asked to do so. I will commit the code myself.

NEVER use git to revert files to previous state if you did not create those files yourself! there can be user changes in files you touched, if you revert those changes the user will be very upset!

## files

always use kebab case for new filenames. never use uppercase letters in filenames

never write temporary files to /tmp. instead write them to a local ./tmp folder instead. make sure it is in .gitignore too

## see files in the repo

use `git ls-files | tree --fromfile` to see files in the repo. this command will ignore files ignored by git

## handling unexpected file contents after a read or write

if you find code that was not there since the last time you read the file it means the user or another agent edited the file. do not revert the changes that were added. instead keep them and integrate them with your new changes

IMPORTANT: NEVER commit your changes unless clearly and specifically asked to!

## opening me files in zed to show me a specific portion of code

you can open files when i ask me "open in zed the line where ..." using the command `zed path/to/file:line`

# typescript

- ALWAYS use normal imports instead of dynamic imports, unless there is an issue with es module only packages and you are in a commonjs package (this is rare).
- when throwing errors always use clause instead of error inside message: `new Error("wrapping error", { cause: e })` instead of `new Error(\`wrapping error ${e}\`)`

- use a single object argument instead of multiple positional args: use object arguments for new typescript functions if the function would accept more than one argument, so it is more readable, ({a,b,c}) instead of (a,b,c). this way you can use the object as a sort of named argument feature, where order of arguments does not matter and it's easier to discover parameters.

- always add the {} block body in arrow functions: arrow functions should never be written as `onClick={(x) => setState('')}`. NEVER. instead you should ALWAYS write `onClick={() => {setState('')}}`. this way it's easy to add new statements in the arrow function without refactoring it.

- in array operations .map, .filter, .reduce and .flatMap are preferred over .forEach and for of loops. For example prefer doing `.push(...array.map(x => x.items))` over mutating array variables inside for loops. Always think of how to turn for loops into expressions using .map, .filter or .flatMap if you ever are about to write a for loop.

- if you encounter typescript errors like "undefined | T is not assignable to T" after .filter(Boolean) operations: use a guarded function instead of Boolean: `.filter(isTruthy)`. implemented as `function isTruthy<T>(value: T): value is NonNullable<T> { return Boolean(value) }`

- minimize useless comments: do not add useless comments if the code is self descriptive. only add comments if requested or if this was a change that i asked for, meaning it is not obvious code and needs some inline documentation. if a comment is required because the part of the code was result of difficult back and forth with me, keep it very short.

- ALWAYS add all information encapsulated in my prompt to comments: when my prompt is super detailed and in depth, all this information should be added to comments in your code. this is because if the prompt is very detailed it must be the fruit of a lot of research. all this information would be lost if you don't put it in the code. next LLM calls would misinterpret the code and miss context.

- NEVER write comments that reference changes between previous and old code generated between iterations of our conversation. do that in prompt instead. comments should be used for information of the current code. code that is deleted does not matter.

- use early returns (and breaks in loops): do not nest code too much. follow the go best practice of if statements: avoid else, nest as little as possible, use top level ifs. minimize nesting. instead of doing `if (x) { if (b) {} }` you should do `if (x && b) {};` for example. you can always convert multiple nested ifs or elses into many linear ifs at one nesting level. use the @think tool for this if necessary.

- typecheck after updating code: after any change to typescript code ALWAYS run the `pnpm typecheck` script of that package, or if there is no typecheck script run `pnpm tsc` yourself

- do not use any: you must NEVER use any. if you find yourself using `as any` or `:any`, use the @think tool to think hard if there are types you can import instead. do even a search in the project for what the type could be. any should be used as a last resort.

- NEVER do `(x as any).field` or `'field' in x` before checking if the code compiles first without it. the code probably doesn't need any or the in check. even if it does not compile, use think tool first! before adding (x as any).something, ALWAYS read the .d.ts to understand the types

- do not declare uninitialized variables that are defined later in the flow. instead use an IIFE with returns. this way there is less state. also define the type of the variable before the iife. here is an example:

- use || over in: avoid 'x' in obj checks. prefer doing `obj?.x || ''` over doing `'x' in obj ? obj.x : ''`. only use the in operator if that field causes problems in typescript checks because typescript thinks the field is missing, as a last resort.

- when creating urls from a path and a base url, prefer using `new URL(path, baseUrl).toString()` instead of normal string interpolation. use type-safe react-router `href` or spiceflow `this.safePath` (available inside routes) if possible

- for node built-in imports, never import singular exported names. instead do `import fs from 'node:fs'`, same for path, os, etc.

- NEVER start the development server with pnpm dev yourself. there is no reason to do so, even with &

- When creating classes do not add setters and getters for a simple private field. instead make the field public directly so user can get it or set it himself without abstractions on top

- if you encounter typescript lint errors for an npm package, read the node_modules/package/\*.d.ts files to understand the typescript types of the package. if you cannot understand them, ask me to help you with it.

- NEVER silently suppress errors in catch {} blocks if they contain more than one function call
```ts
// BAD. DO NOT DO THIS
let favicon: string | undefined;
if (docsConfig?.favicon) {
  if (typeof docsConfig.favicon === "string") {
    favicon = docsConfig.favicon;
  } else if (docsConfig.favicon?.light) {
    // Use light favicon as default, could be enhanced with theme detection
    favicon = docsConfig.favicon.light;
  }
}
// DO THIS. use an iife. Immediately Invoked Function Expression
const favicon: string = (() => {
  if (!docsConfig?.favicon) {
    return "";
  }
  if (typeof docsConfig.favicon === "string") {
    return docsConfig.favicon;
  }
  if (docsConfig.favicon?.light) {
    // Use light favicon as default, could be enhanced with theme detection
    return docsConfig.favicon.light;
  }
  return "";
})();
// if you already know the type use it:
const favicon: string = () => {
  // ...
};
```

- when a package has to import files from another packages in the workspace never add a new tsconfig path, instead add that package as a workspace dependency using `pnpm i "package@workspace:*"`

NEVER use require. always esm imports

always try to use non-relative imports. each package has an absolute import with the package name, you can find it in the tsconfig.json paths section. for example, paths inside website can be imported from website. notice these paths also need to include the src directory.

this is preferable to other aliases like @/ because i can easily move the code from one package to another without changing the import paths. this way you can even move a file and import paths do not change much.

always specify the type when creating arrays, especially for empty arrays. if you don't, typescript will infer the type as `never[]`, which can cause type errors when adding elements later.

**Example:**

```ts
// BAD: Type will be never[]
const items = [];

// GOOD: Specify the expected type
const items: string[] = [];
const numbers: number[] = [];
const users: User[] = [];
```

remember to always add the explicit type to avoid unexpected type inference.

- when using nodejs APIs like fs always import the module and not the named exports. I prefer hacing nodejs APIs accessed on the module namspace like fs, os, path, etc.

DO `import fs from 'fs'; fs.writeFileSync(...)`
DO NOT `import { writeFileSync } from 'fs';`

- NEVER pass a string to abortController.abort(). instead if you want to pass a reason always pass an Error instance. like `controller.abort(new Error('reason'))`. This way catch blocks receive an Error instance and not something else.

# package manager: pnpm with workspace

this project uses pnpm workspaces to manage dependencies. important scripts are in the root package.json or various packages' package.json

try to run commands inside the package folder that you are working on. for example you should never run `pnpm test` from the root

if you need to install packages always use pnpm

instead of adding packages directly in package.json use `pnpm install package` inside the right workspace folder. NEVER manually add a package by updating package.json

## updating a package

when i ask you to update a package always run `pnpm update -r packagename`. to update to latest also add --latest

Do not do `pnpm add packagename` to update a package. only to add a missing one. otherwise other packages versions will get out of sync.

## fixing duplicate pnpm dependencies

sometimes typescript will fail if there are 2 duplicate packages in the workspace node_modules. this can happen in pnpm if a package is used in 2 different places (even if inside a node_module package, transitive dependency) with a different set of versions for a peer dependency

for example if better-auth depends on zod peer dep and zod is in different versions in 2 dependency subtrees

to identify if a pnpm package is duplicated, search for the string " packagename@" inside `pnpm-lock.yaml`, notice the space in the search string. then if the result returns multiple instances with a different set of peer deps inside the round brackets, it means that this package is being duplicated. here is an example of a package getting duplicated:

```

  better-auth@1.3.6(react-dom@19.1.1(react@19.1.1))(react@19.1.1)(zod@3.25.76):
    dependencies:
      '@better-auth/utils': 0.2.6
      '@better-fetch/fetch': 1.1.18
      '@noble/ciphers': 0.6.0
      '@noble/hashes': 1.8.0
      '@simplewebauthn/browser': 13.1.2
      '@simplewebauthn/server': 13.1.2
      better-call: 1.0.13
      defu: 6.1.4
      jose: 5.10.0
      kysely: 0.28.5
      nanostores: 0.11.4
      zod: 3.25.76
    optionalDependencies:
      react: 19.1.1
      react-dom: 19.1.1(react@19.1.1)

  better-auth@1.3.6(react-dom@19.1.1(react@19.1.1))(react@19.1.1)(zod@4.0.17):
    dependencies:
      '@better-auth/utils': 0.2.6
      '@better-fetch/fetch': 1.1.18
      '@noble/ciphers': 0.6.0
      '@noble/hashes': 1.8.0
      '@simplewebauthn/browser': 13.1.2
      '@simplewebauthn/server': 13.1.2
      better-call: 1.0.13
      defu: 6.1.4
      jose: 5.10.0
      kysely: 0.28.5
      nanostores: 0.11.4
      zod: 4.0.17
    optionalDependencies:
      react: 19.1.1
      react-dom: 19.1.1(react@19.1.1)

```

as you can see, better-auth is listed twice with different sets of peer deps. in this case it's because of zod being in version 3 and 4 in two subtrees of our workspace dependencies.

as a first step, try running `pnpm dedupe better-auth` with your package name and see if there is still the problem.

below i will describe how to generally deduplicate a package. i will use zod as an example. it works with any dependency found in the previous step.

to deduplicate the package, we have to make sure we only have 1 version of zod installed in your workspace. DO NOT use overrides for this. instead, fix the problem by manually updating the dependencies that are forcing the older version of zod in the dependency tree.

to do so, we first have to run the command `pnpm -r why zod@3.25.76` to see the reason the older zod version is installed. in this case, the result is something like this:

```

website /Users/morse/Documents/GitHub/holocron/website (PRIVATE)

dependencies:
@better-auth/stripe 1.2.10
├─┬ better-auth 1.3.6
│ └── zod 3.25.76 peer
└── zod 3.25.76
db link:../db
└─┬ docs-website link:../docs-website
  ├─┬ fumadocs-docgen 2.0.1
  │ └── zod 3.25.76
  ├─┬ fumadocs-openapi link:../fumadocs/packages/openapi
  │ └─┬ @modelcontextprotocol/sdk 1.17.3
  │   ├── zod 3.25.76
  │   └─┬ zod-to-json-schema 3.24.6
  │     └── zod 3.25.76 peer
  └─┬ searchapi link:../searchapi
    └─┬ agents 0.0.109
      ├─┬ @modelcontextprotocol/sdk 1.17.3
      │ ├── zod 3.25.76
      │ └─┬ zod-to-json-schema 3.24.6
      │   └── zod 3.25.76 peer
      └─┬ ai 4.3.19
        ├─┬ @ai-sdk/provider-utils 2.2.8
        │ └── zod 3.25.76 peer
        └─┬ @ai-sdk/react 1.2.12
          ├─┬ @ai-sdk/provider-utils 2.2.8
          │ └── zod 3.25.76 peer
          └─┬ @ai-sdk/ui-utils 1.2.11
            └─┬ @ai-sdk/provider-utils 2.2.8
              └── zod 3.25.76 peer
```

here we can see zod 3 is installed because of @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, @better-auth/stripe and agents packages. to fix the problem, we can run

```
pnpm update -r --latest  @modelcontextprotocol/sdk @better-auth/stripe agents
```

this way, if these packages include the newer version of the dependency, zod will be deduplicated automatically.

in this case, we could have only updated @better-auth/stripe to fix the issue too, that's because @better-auth/stripe is the one that has better-auth as a peer dep. but finding what is the exact problematic package is difficult, so it is easier to just update all packages you notice that we depend on directly in our workspace package.json files.

if after doing this we still have duplicate packages, you will have to ask the user for help. you can try deleting the node_modules and restarting the approach, but it rarely helps.

# sentry

this project uses sentry to notify about unexpected errors.

the website folder will have a src/lib/errors.ts file with an exported function `notifyError(error: Error, contextMessage: string)`.

you should ALWAYS use notifyError in these cases:

- create a new spiceflow api app, put notifyError in the onError callback with context message including the api route path
- suppressing an error for operations that can fail. instead of doing console.error(error) you should instead call notifyError
- wrapping a promise with cloudflare `waitUntil`. add a .catch and a notifyError so errors are tracked

this function will add the error in sentry so that the developer is able to track users' errors

## errors.ts file

if a package is missing the errors.ts file, here is the template for adding one.

notice that

- dsn should be replaced by the user with the right one. ask to do so
- use the sentries npm package, this handles correctly every environment like Bun, Node, Browser, etc

```tsx
import { captureException, flush, init } from "sentries";

init({
  dsn: "https://e702f9c3dff49fd1aa16500c6056d0f7@o4509638447005696.ingest.de.sentry.io/4509638454476880",
  integrations: [],
  tracesSampleRate: 0.01,
  profilesSampleRate: 0.01,
  beforeSend(event) {
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
      return null;
    }
    if (process.env.BYTECODE_RUN) {
      return null;
    }
    if (event?.["name"] === "AbortError") {
      return null;
    }

    return event;
  },
});

export async function notifyError(error: any, msg?: string) {
  console.error(msg, error);
  captureException(error, { extra: { msg } });
  await flush(1000);
}

export class AppError extends Error {
  constructor(message: string) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "AppError";
  }
}
```

## app error

every time you throw a user-readable error you should use AppError instead of Error

AppError messages will be forwarded to the user as is. normal Error instances instead could have their messages obfuscated

# testing

.toMatchInlineSnapshot is the preferred way to write tests. leave them empty the first time, update them with -u. check git diff for the test file every time you update them with -u

never use timeouts longer than 5 seconds for expects and other statements timeouts. increase timeouts for tests if required, up to 1 minute

do not create dumb tests that test nothing. do not write tests if there is not already a test file or describe block for that function or module.

if the inputs for the tests is an array of repetitive fields and long content, generate this input data programmatically instead of hardcoding everything. only hardcode the important parts and generate other repetitive fields in a .map or .reduce

tests should validate complex and non-obvious logic. if a test looks like a placeholder, do not add it.

use vitest or bun test to run tests. tests should be run from the current package directory and not root. try using the test script instead of vitest directly. additional vitest flags can be added at the end, like --run to disable watch mode or -u to update snapshots.

to understand how the code you are writing works, you should add inline snapshots in the test files with expect().toMatchInlineSnapshot(), then run the test with `pnpm test -u --run` or `pnpm vitest -u --run` to update the snapshot in the file, then read the file again to inspect the result. if the result is not expected, update the code and repeat until the snapshot matches your expectations. never write the inline snapshots in test files yourself. just leave them empty and run `pnpm test -u --run` to update them.

> always call `pnpm vitest` or `pnpm test` with `--run` or they will hang forever waiting for changes!
> ALWAYS read back the test if you use the `-u` option to make sure the inline snapshots are as you expect.

- NEVER write the snapshots content yourself in `toMatchInlineSnapshot`. instead leave it as is and call `pnpm test -u` to fill in snapshots content. the first time you call `toMatchInlineSnapshot()` you can leave it empty

- when updating implementation and `toMatchInlineSnapshot` should change, DO NOT remove the inline snapshots yourself, just run `pnpm test -u` instead! This will replace contents of the snapshots without wasting time doing it yourself.

- for very long snapshots you should use `toMatchFileSnapshot(filename)` instead of `toMatchInlineSnapshot()`. put the snapshot files in a snapshots/ directory and use the appropriate extension for the file based on the content

never test client react components. only React and browser independent code. 

most tests should be simple calls to functions with some expect calls, no mocks. test files should be called the same as the file where the tested function is being exported from.

NEVER use mocks. the database does not need to be mocked, just use it. simply do not test functions that mutate the database if not asked.

tests should strive to be as simple as possible. the best test is a simple `.toMatchInlineSnapshot()` call. these can be easily evaluated by reading the test file after the run passing the -u option. you can clearly see from the inline snapshot if the function behaves as expected or not.

try to use only describe and test in your tests. do not use beforeAll, before, etc if not strictly required.

NEVER write tests for react components or react hooks. NEVER write tests for react components. you will be fired if you do.

sometimes tests work directly on database data, using prisma. to run these tests you have to use the package.json script, which will call `doppler run -- vitest` or similar. never run doppler cli yourself as you could delete or update production data. tests generally use a staging database instead.

never write tests yourself that call prisma or interact with database or emails. for these, ask the user to write them for you.

# writing docs

when generating a .md or .mdx file to document things, always add a frontmatter with title and description. also add a prompt field with the exact prompt used to generate the doc. use @ to reference files and urls and provide any context necessary to be able to recreate this file from scratch using a model. if you used urls also reference them. reference all files you had to read to create the doc. use yaml | syntax to add this prompt and never go over the column width of 80

# styling

- always use tailwind for styling. prefer using simple styles using flex and gap. margins should be avoided, instead use flexbox gaps, grid gaps, or separate spacing divs.

- use shadcn theme colors instead of tailwind default colors. this way there is no need to add `dark:` variants most of the time.

- `flex flex-col gap-3` is preferred over `space-y-3`. same for the x direction.

- try to keep styles as simple as possible, for breakpoints too.

- to join many classes together use the `cn('class-1', 'class-2')` utility instead of `${}` or other methods. this utility is usually used in shadcn-compatible projects and mine is exported from `website/src/lib/cn` usually. prefer doing `cn(bool && 'class')` instead of `cn(bool ? 'class' : '')`

- prefer `size-4` over `w-4 h-4`

## components

this project uses shadcn components placed in the website/src/components/ui folder. never add a new shadcn component yourself by writing code. instead use the shadcn cli installed locally.

try to reuse these available components when you can, for example for buttons, tooltips, scroll areas, etc.

## reusing shadcn components

when creating a new React component or adding jsx before creating your own buttons or other elements first check the files inside `src/components/ui` and `src/components` to see what is already available. So you can reuse things like Button and Tooltip components instead of creating your own.

# tailwind v4

this project uses tailwind v4. this new tailwind version does not use tailwind.config.js. instead it does all configuration in css files.

read https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide to understand the updates landed in tailwind v4 if you do not have tailwind v4 in your training context. ignore the parts that talk about running the upgrade cli. this project already uses tailwind v4 so no need to upgrade anything.

## spacing should use multiples of 4

for margin, padding, gaps, widths and heights it is preferable to use multiples of 4 of the tailwind spacing scale. for example p-4 or gap-4

4 is equal to 16px which is the default font size of the page. this way every spacing is a multiple of the height and width of a default letter.

user interfaces are mostly text so using the letter width and height as a base unit makes it easier to reason about the layout and sizes.

use grow instead of flex-1.

# spiceflow

before writing or updating spiceflow related code always execute this command to get Spiceflow full documentation: `curl -s https://gitchamber.com/repos/remorses/spiceflow/main/files/README.md`

spiceflow is an API library similar to hono, it allows you to write api servers using whatwg requests and responses

use zod to create schemas and types that need to be used for tool inputs or spiceflow API routes.

## calling the server from the clientE

you can obtain a type safe client for the API using `createSpiceflowClient` from `spiceflow/client`

for simple routes that only have one interaction in the page, for example a form page, you should use react-router forms and actions to interact with the server.

but when you do interactions from a component that can be rendered from multiple routes, or simply is not implemented inside a route page, you should use spiceflow client instead.

> ALWAYS use the fetch tool to get the latest docs if you need to implement a new route in a spiceflow API app server or need to add a new rpc call with a spiceflow api client!

spiceflow has support for client-side type-safe rpc. use this client when you need to interact with the server from the client, for example for a settings save deep inside a component. here is example usage of it

> SUPER IMPORTANT! if you add a new route to a spiceflow app, use the spiceflow app state like `userId` to add authorization to the route. if there is no state then you can use functions like `getSession({request})` or similar.
> make sure the current userId has access to the fetched or updated rows. this can be done by checking that the parent row or current row has a relation with the current userId. for example `prisma.site.findFirst({where: {users: {some: {userId }}}})`

> IMPORTANT! spiceflow api client cannot be called server side to call a route! In that case instead you MUST call the server functions used in the route directly, otherwise the server would do fetch requests that would fail!

always use `const {data, error} = await apiClient...` when calling spiceflow rpc. if data is already declared, give it a different name with `const {data: data2, error} = await apiClient...`. this pattern of destructuring is preferred for all apis that return data and error object fields.

## getting spiceflow docs

spiceflow is a little-known api framework. if you add server routes to a file that includes spiceflow in the name or you are using the apiClient rpc, you always need to fetch the spiceflow docs first, using the @fetch tool on https://getspiceflow.com/

this url returns a single long documentation that covers your use case. always fetch this document so you know how to use spiceflow. spiceflow is different from hono and other api frameworks, that's why you should ALWAYS fetch the docs first before using it

## using spiceflow client in published public workspace packages

usually you can just import the App type from the server workspace to create the client with createSpiceflowClient

if you want to use the spiceflow client in a published package instead we will use the pattern of generating .d.ts and copying these in the workspace package, this way the package does not need to depend on unpublished private server package.

example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "gen-client": "export DIR=../plugin-mcp/src/generated/ && cd ../website && tsc --incremental && cd ../plugin-mcp && rm -rf $DIR && mkdir -p $DIR && cp ../website/dist/src/lib/api-client.* $DIR"
  }
}
```

notice that if you add a route in the spiceflow server you will need to run `pnpm --filter website gen-client` to update the apiClient inside cli.

# ai sdk

i use the vercel ai sdk to interact with LLMs, also known as the npm package `ai`. never use the openai sdk or provider-specific sdks, always use the vercel ai sdk, npm package `ai`. streamText is preferred over generateText, unless the model used is very small and fast and the current code doesn't care about streaming tokens or showing a preview to the user. `streamObject` is also preferred over generateObject.

ALWAYS fetch the latest docs for the ai sdk using this url with curl:
https://gitchamber.com/repos/vercel/ai/main/files

use gitchamber to read the .md files using curl

you can swap out the topic with text you want to search docs for. you can also limit the total results returned with the param token to limit the tokens that will be added to the context window
# playwright

you can control the browser using the playwright mcp tools. these tools let you control the browser to get information or accomplish actions

if i ask you to test something in the browser, know that the website dev server is already running at http://localhost:7664 for website and :7777 for docs-website (but docs-website needs to use the website domain specifically, for example name-hash.localhost:7777)
# zod

when you need to create a complex type that comes from a prisma table, do not create a new schema that tries to recreate the prisma table structure. instead just use `z.any() as ZodType<PrismaTable>)` to get type safety but leave any in the schema. this gets most of the benefits of zod without having to define a new zod schema that can easily go out of sync.

## converting zod schema to jsonschema

you MUST use the built in zod v4 toJSONSchema and not the npm package `zod-to-json-schema` which is outdated and does not support zod v4.

```ts
import { toJSONSchema } from "zod";

const mySchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  name: z.string().min(3).max(100),
  age: z.number().min(0).optional(),
});

const jsonSchema = toJSONSchema(mySchema, {
  removeAdditionalStrategy: "strict",
});
```
