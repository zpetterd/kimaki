# Changelog

## 0.7.0

1. **New `/fork-subagent` command** — fork an active subagent task session into its own Discord thread. Shows a dropdown of running subagent tasks with their prompt previews. The new thread inherits the full session context (memory, tool outputs, event history) so you can continue the subagent's work independently:

   ```text
   /fork-subagent
   ```

2. **Callout containers in Discord** — the bot now renders accent-colored callout blocks (warnings, tips, action-required notes) as Discord Components V2 containers. Callouts can recursively include tables and action buttons, making structured responses easier to scan. The system prompt includes color-coded callout types: orange for warnings, blue for TODOs, red for tool failures, purple for gist summaries.

3. **`/add-dir` directory option now optional** — omit the directory argument to default to `*` (all directories) for the current session. Explicit paths are still resolved against the active worktree when provided:

   ```text
   # Allow all directories (no argument needed)
   /add-dir

   # Allow a specific directory (still works)
   /add-dir ../shared-data
   ```

4. **Fix: Anthropic plugin per-session directory resolution** — the Anthropic auth plugin now extracts the per-session working directory from the OpenCode identity block instead of using the server's cwd. Fixes incorrect file paths in multi-session and worktree setups.

5. **Fix: faster startup when replacing a running instance** — the Hrana database server now polls the old process every second during eviction instead of sleeping a fixed 6 seconds. Startup is faster when the old instance shuts down promptly while still allowing graceful cleanup.

## 0.6.0

1. **Subagent rate-limit handling** — when a task-created child session hits a provider rate limit (HTTP 429), kimaki now automatically aborts the subagent session instead of letting the error cascade to the parent. The parent task session recovers on its own, keeping rate-limit noise out of your Discord threads.

2. **Bash tool for the voice assistant** — the GenAI worker now includes a shell execution tool that can run commands in the project directory. It also supports remote skill loading: skill SKILL.md files fetched from URLs are cached locally and their metadata is injected into the tool description so the model can discover specialized workflows.

3. **Common toolchain caches pre-allowed** — zig, cargo, go build, and go pkg cache directories under `~` are now pre-allowed as external directories. Agents using these toolchains no longer trigger permission prompts for inspecting downloaded modules and build artifacts.

4. **Fixed infinite abort-replay loop on large contexts** — when the LLM took >3 seconds to return the first token (e.g. 239K token prompts), the interrupt plugin would abort and replay the message in a tight loop every 3 seconds. Replayed message IDs are now tracked to break the cycle.

5. **Fixed unscoped Discord toasts** — global plugin toasts without a session-scoped marker were being forwarded into unrelated Discord threads. Toasts are now only rendered when they carry a session ID, preventing rate-limit and status toasts from spamming conversations.

6. **Fixed Anthropic OAuth identity in system prompt** — the Anthropic auth plugin now correctly rebrands the openc0de identity and allows `~/.config/openc0de` as a valid config directory, fixing repeated auth failures.

7. **Fixed home directory resolution bug** — corrected path resolution for the user's home directory in opencode startup.

## 0.5.0

1. **New `/add-dir` Discord command** — expand the current session's directory access permissions without restarting. In a thread with an active session, run `/add-dir <path>` to grant the AI access to a specific external directory, or `/add-dir *` to allow all directories:
   ```text
   /add-dir ../other-project
   /add-dir /tmp/shared-data
   /add-dir *
   ```

2. **Worktree sessions can no longer edit the main checkout** — when a thread moves into a git worktree, existing and newly created sessions automatically deny write access to the original repo path. This prevents the agent from accidentally modifying the main branch while working in a worktree.

3. **System prompt drift notices show inline diff snippets** — the "Context cache discarded" toast now includes a short markdown diff snippet directly in Discord, instead of writing a debug file to disk. Makes it immediately visible which parts of the system prompt changed.

4. **`kimaki tunnel` now injects `TRAFORO_URL` into the child process** — apps launched through `kimaki tunnel` can read `process.env.TRAFORO_URL` to wire OAuth callbacks, webhook URLs, and absolute links to the public tunnel instead of localhost:
   ```bash
   kimaki tunnel -- sh -c 'BETTER_AUTH_URL=$TRAFORO_URL exec pnpm dev'
   ```

5. **Fixed OpenCode directory resolution for worktree sessions** — agent, model, provider, and config calls now pass the worktree-aware directory instead of the client default, so worktree sessions resolve against the active checkout correctly.

6. **Fixed OpenCode log chunking** — stderr/stdout from the opencode server process is now read line-by-line instead of splitting raw chunks, preventing garbled or merged log lines.

## 0.4.104

1. **Queued messages now keep moving while question dropdowns are open** — if the assistant asks a dropdown question and you queue a follow-up message, kimaki now hands off the first queued item immediately instead of waiting for the dropdown to be answered. This keeps the visible `» user:` dispatch indicator moving and prevents queued work from feeling stuck behind interactive prompts.

## 0.4.103

1. **`btw` message shortcut for side-question forks** — type `btw fix the auth bug` directly in a thread to fork the session with full context, without using the `/btw` slash command. Supports punctuation separators like `btw. check this`, `btw, why is this broken`, `btw: look at that`. Thread titles preserve the `btw:` and `Fork:` prefixes when OpenCode renames them.

2. **`--enable-skill` / `--disable-skill` flags** — control which bundled skills get injected into the model's system prompt:
   ```bash
   # only load specific skills
   kimaki --enable-skill drizzle --enable-skill errore

   # hide noisy skills
   kimaki --disable-skill jitter --disable-skill termcast
   ```
   Flags are mutually exclusive (whitelist vs blacklist) and repeatable.

3. **`/worktrees` now shows all worktrees, not just kimaki-created ones** — uses `git worktree list` as source of truth, enriched with DB metadata (thread links, timestamps). Surfaces kimaki-created, opencode-created, and manually created worktrees in a single table with a Source column.

4. **Shorter worktree folder names** — worktrees now live under `<dataDir>/worktrees/<hash>/<basename>` instead of the deeply nested opencode paths with `opencode-kimaki-` prefix. Shorter paths make the agent less likely to accidentally operate on the wrong worktree.

5. **`kimaki anthropic current-account`** — prints the currently active Anthropic OAuth account email for quick inspection.

6. **Fixed Anthropic system prompt losing working directory** — `sanitizeAnthropicSystemText` was stripping the OpenCode identity block which contains environment context (cwd, OS). The model now retains awareness of the current working directory after the Anthropic rewrite.

7. **Fixed duplicate question dropdowns** — repeated `AskUserQuestion` tool requests no longer produce duplicate Discord select menus. Stale contexts are cleaned up on answer, cancel, or expiry.

8. **Fixed queue drain dumping all messages at once** — answering a dropdown question no longer flushes every locally queued message into OpenCode simultaneously. Only the next queued message is dispatched, preserving normal one-by-one Discord indicators.

9. **Fixed duplicate task start messages** — repeated tool updates for the same part no longer post the same Discord line twice.

10. **Skills from `~/.config/opencode/skills/` now load correctly** — fixed path resolution for user-installed skills outside the bundled skills directory.

## 0.4.102

1. **Fixed OpenCode plugin failing to load in the published npm package** — kimaki now loads `dist/kimaki-opencode-plugin.js` in published builds instead of the TypeScript source entrypoint, which imported `.js` sibling files that don't exist under `src/` in the npm tarball. Users running kimaki under PM2 or npx saw `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find module 'ipc-tools-plugin.js'` on startup; this is now fixed.

2. **`~/.opensrc` is now pre-allowed in OpenCode permissions** — agents can inspect cached opensrc package checkouts without triggering interactive permission prompts.

## 0.4.101

1. **Claude Max login works again when Anthropic shows the new third-party app billing prompt** — kimaki now rewrites Anthropic's transformed system prompt in the hook Anthropic actually reads, so OAuth login keeps working when Claude shows messages like "Third-party apps now draw from your extra usage" instead of silently falling back to a broken prompt state.

2. **`MEMORY.md` heading overview is now frozen per session** — kimaki snapshots the condensed `MEMORY.md` table of contents on the first real user message and reuses that same overview for the rest of the session. Editing `MEMORY.md` mid-session no longer mutates the active system prompt or invalidates the session cache; starting a new session still picks up the latest headings.

3. **`/login` now surfaces `opencode` and `opencode-go` providers** — the provider picker prioritizes both entries so they are easier to find when signing in through Discord:
   ```text
   /login
   ```

## 0.4.100

1. **`/vscode` now opens reliably through the Kimaki tunnel** — the browser editor no longer depends on Coderaft's `?tkn=` connection-token redirect flow, which could fail and return `Forbidden` after passing through the public tunnel. Kimaki now launches Coderaft without a connection token and returns the unique tunnel URL directly:
   ```text
   /vscode
   ```
   The session still auto-stops after 30 minutes, and the generated tunnel host remains high-entropy and hard to guess.

## 0.4.99

1. **Existing gateway installs now auto-migrate to `kimaki.dev`** — on startup, kimaki rewrites saved gateway proxy URLs from `discord-gateway.kimaki.xyz` to `discord-gateway.kimaki.dev` in local SQLite for gateway mode. This prevents legacy endpoint drift that could cause Discord interactions to time out with "application did not respond".

## 0.4.98

1. **New `/vscode` Discord command** — open the current project or worktree in browser VS Code (Coderaft) through a private tunnel, with automatic 30-minute shutdown. This is useful for quick remote edits without leaving Discord:
   ```text
   /vscode
   ```

2. **`kimaki.dev` is now the default domain for new sessions and links** — default onboarding website URL, gateway proxy URL, and tunnel-based features now point to `kimaki.dev`. Existing `kimaki.xyz` routes remain supported during migration.

3. **System prompt drift notices are less noisy** — drift detection now waits until system-transform hooks finish mutating the prompt before comparing turns, reducing false positives in "Context cache discarded" toasts.

## 0.4.97

1. **Anthropic account CLI commands are now visible in help** — `kimaki anthropic account list/add/remove` commands appear in normal `--help` output. `remove` now accepts either a 1-based index or a stored email address for easier cleanup.

2. **Anthropic account identity persisted across OAuth rotation** — kimaki fetches your Anthropic profile email and account IDs during login and stores them alongside credentials. Account records are deduplicated by stable identity so rotating tokens doesn't create phantom duplicate entries.

3. **Anthropic plugin toasts scoped to the active session** — account-switch and rewrite warnings now appear only in the Discord thread that triggered the event instead of broadcasting to all threads.

4. **Worktrees now branch from current HEAD** — new worktrees start from whatever your local checkout is at, including commits that haven't been pushed yet. Previously, only the remote `origin/HEAD` was used as the base.

## 0.4.96

1. **System prompt drift toasts now route to the correct Discord thread** — toasts from the `systemPromptDriftPlugin` are now scoped to the active session's thread. A hidden session marker is appended in the plugin and stripped before rendering, so drift notices appear only in the thread that triggered the event instead of broadcasting globally.

2. **Simpler debug filenames for system prompt drift** — saved system prompt and diff files now share a timestamped basename (e.g. `2026-04-08T10-01.md` / `2026-04-08T10-01.diff`) instead of using the session ID, keeping the debug paths shorter and each event self-contained.

3. **Cleaner drift toast copy** — diff and latest-prompt paths are now shown as inline code; wording is lower-cased and the extra explanatory sentence is removed to keep the notice concise.

## 0.4.95

1. **Fixed Claude Max subscription prompt stripping** — instead of replacing the entire system prompt or splicing out the whole OpenCode identity block, kimaki now removes only the section from `"You are OpenCode…"` up to `"# Code References"`, preserving the rest of the prompt that Anthropic's API expects. This restores correct behaviour for Claude Pro/Max OAuth users. Shows a toast error if the expected marker is not found.

2. **Fixed discord.js CJS interop in plugin chain** — the plugin loader now uses a namespace import for discord.js to avoid CJS/ESM interop crashes when running inside the OpenCode plugin host process.

## 0.4.94

1. **Fixed Claude Max subscription support** — the error message "Third-party apps now draw from your extra usage, not your plan limits" no longer breaks authentication. Kimaki now correctly detects active Max subscriptions and continues using them without requiring a re-login.

2. **New `systemPromptDriftPlugin`** — detects when the effective system prompt changes between turns inside an OpenCode session. When drift is detected, it writes a unified diff to the Kimaki data directory and shows a Discord toast with addition/deletion counts, making it easy to spot which plugin is busting the prompt cache and driving up rate-limit usage.

3. **Log output is now capped at 1 000 characters per argument** — prevents runaway log files when tools return very large outputs. Truncated portions show a `… [truncated N chars]` suffix so nothing is silently dropped.

4. **Softer wording on worktree directory reminders** — the mid-session reminder injected when switching to a worktree now says "You should read, write, and edit files under …" instead of "You MUST …", reducing unnecessary alarm in the agent's context.

## 0.4.93

1. **Claude account rotation is now visible in Discord** — when Anthropic OAuth hits a rate limit or auth failure and kimaki rotates to another saved Claude account, the thread now shows a toast-style notice with the account labels so you can see which account it switched from and to.

2. **`/merge-worktree` conflict recovery now preserves both sides more reliably** — when a rebase conflict happens during merge, the follow-up AI instructions now explicitly walk through reading the merge base, both sides' commit history, and both diffs before editing conflicted files. This reduces the chance of the model dropping a fix or feature while resolving conflicts.

3. **Agent-switch replies now say when the change applies** — thread-scoped `/agent` and quick `/<agent>-agent` commands now tell you the new agent takes effect on the next message, instead of implying the running turn changed immediately.

4. **Footer keeps more of long folder and branch names** — kimaki now truncates footer folder and branch labels at 30 characters instead of 15, so project info stays readable without overflowing Discord.

## 0.4.92

1. **Fixed `/command-cmd` prompts being sent to the model when the bot starts up** — when using `kimaki send --prompt "/hello-test-cmd"` (or any `/commandname-cmd` prompt), the command was routed as plain text to the model instead of being executed via `session.command`. This happened because the registered commands list is empty during the gateway startup race (before `backgroundInit` completes). The detector now falls back to suffix-stripping (`-cmd`, `-skill`, `-mcp-prompt`) when the list is empty, so commands are correctly routed regardless of startup timing. Fixes [#97](https://github.com/remorses/kimaki/issues/97).

2. **Footer truncates long folder and branch names** — project directory names and branch names longer than 15 characters are now capped with a `…` suffix so the footer line stays compact in Discord.

3. **Subagent sessions excluded from external sync** — helper task sessions (whose title ends with `subagent)`) no longer create or update mirrored Discord threads in external sync, reducing noise.

## 0.4.91

1. **New `--cwd` flag for `kimaki send`** — start a session using an existing git worktree directory instead of the main project directory:
   ```bash
   kimaki send --channel <id> --prompt "task" --cwd /path/to/worktree
   kimaki send --channel <id> --prompt "task" --cwd /path/to/worktree --send-at "2026-04-07T09:00:00Z"
   ```
   The path is validated against `git worktree list` to ensure it belongs to the project. If `--cwd` points to the main project directory it is silently ignored.

2. **Discord reply context in prompts** — when you reply to a Discord message in a session thread, the agent now sees what message you replied to as part of the turn context. Useful for referencing earlier responses without quoting them manually.

3. **Fixed queued prompts being dropped after an interrupted session** — when OpenCode aborted a running turn (e.g. a long tool call), follow-up messages queued via `/queue` or the bot's queue mechanism were silently discarded or sent to the wrong model. The interrupt plugin now replays the original queued message with its full prompt parts, agent, and model context after abort.

4. **Fixed external sync session discovery** — the external sync poller reverted to per-directory session listing which reliably finds active sessions. The previous global endpoint caused sync to miss sessions and show stale state in linked channels.

5. **Fixed OpenCode plugin compatibility with recent OpenCode releases** — resolved plugin startup failures caused by clack logger imports and plugin logging isolation issues that broke after upstream OpenCode changes.

6. **OpenCode server warnings and errors now appear in kimaki logs** — opencode server log output at warning level and above is forwarded to `~/.kimaki/kimaki.log`, making it easier to debug server-side issues without checking separate log files.

7. **Removed automatic Kimaki Discord role management** — the bot no longer auto-creates or repositions a "Kimaki" role in your server on startup. Role management is left to server admins.

## 0.4.90

1. **Fixed `/btw` forked sessions continuing the parent task** — the forked thread now only answers the side question and does not resume or reference whatever the original session was working on. The prompt is wrapped with explicit framing so the model stays focused on the question.

2. **Fixed `external_directory` permission defaults being overridden** — kimaki was injecting a catch-all `'*': 'ask'` rule that silently overrode whatever you set in your project's `opencode.json`. The wildcard is now removed; only the specific directory allowlists (tmpdir, `~/.config/opencode`, `~/.kimaki`, project dir, worktree origin) are kept. Fixes [#90](https://github.com/remorses/kimaki/issues/90) and [#92](https://github.com/remorses/kimaki/issues/92).

3. **`kimaki project create` now respects `--projects-dir`** — the root command already accepted `--projects-dir` but the `project create` subcommand didn't, so running it standalone always used the default path. Now `kimaki project create my-app --projects-dir /custom/path` works as expected.

4. **Added CI workflow for integration tests** — automated test runs on every push to catch regressions early.

## 0.4.89

1. **New `--injection-guard` flag for `kimaki send`** — enable prompt-injection scanning only for the session you are starting, without turning it on globally for the whole project:
   ```bash
   kimaki send --prompt "Review this repo safely" --injection-guard "bash:*"
   kimaki send --thread <thread-id> --prompt "Continue with web checks" --injection-guard "webfetch:*"
   ```
   Patterns use the form `tool:argsGlob`, and you can repeat the flag multiple times to scan several tool families in one session.

2. **Fixed scheduled sends to existing sessions** — `kimaki send --session ... --send-at ...` now reliably wakes the target thread instead of posting a message that leaves the session idle.

3. **Fixed dynamic command threads losing their arguments** — when a slash command like `/<name>-cmd`, `/<name>-skill`, or `/<name>-mcp-prompt` starts a new thread, the starter message and thread title now include the full command invocation instead of dropping the arguments.

4. **Fixed worktree folder-switch reminders** — when a session moves into a new worktree, kimaki now reminds the model about the exact previous folder it must stop editing, reducing accidental reads or writes in the old directory.

## 0.4.88

1. **Built-in prompt injection guard** — kimaki now ships with `opencode-injection-guard`. Opt-in: create `.opencode/injection-guard.json` (even an empty `{}`) in your project to activate it. A fast LLM judge inspects tool call outputs before they reach the main agent, blocking injected instructions from hijacking your coding sessions.

2. **Fixed project-level `opencode.json` permissions being ignored** — kimaki's default permissions (like `external_directory: ask`) were overriding your project's `opencode.json` settings because they were injected via `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` which loads last in opencode's config chain. Kimaki now writes its config to `~/.kimaki/opencode-config.json` and uses `OPENCODE_CONFIG` (file path), which loads before project config — so your project-level permission settings are correctly respected. Fixes [#90](https://github.com/remorses/kimaki/issues/90).

3. **Fixed `kimaki send` thread creation race causing DiscordAPIError[160004]** — `kimaki send` posts a starter message then creates the thread via REST. A recent change accidentally caused the bot's GuildText handler to also try calling `startThread()` on the same message, triggering a "thread already created" error. The GuildText handler now skips messages with a start marker.

4. **Updated OpenCode SDK to 1.3.7** — picks up latest OpenCode improvements.

## 0.4.87

1. **New `/btw` command** — fork the current session into a new thread and immediately send a prompt, without replaying past messages:
   ```
   /btw prompt: why is the auth module structured this way?
   ```
   Useful for side questions or tangents without polluting or blocking the original thread. The forked thread inherits the full session context and starts working right away.

2. **Fixed slash command registration exceeding Discord's 100-command limit** — with many agents, skills, and MCP prompts, the total could exceed Discord's hard cap and cause registration errors. Dynamic commands are now registered in priority order (agents → user commands → skills → MCP prompts) and trimmed at 100. Three rarely-used static commands were removed to free slots: `stop` (duplicate of `/abort`), `memory-snapshot` (use `kill -SIGUSR1` instead), and `toggle-mention-mode`.

## 0.4.86

1. **Fixed voice messages getting lost when a question dropdown is pending** — sending a voice message while the AI's question dropdown is showing no longer discards the voice content. Previously, `message.content` (empty for voice) was passed as the question answer, sending `""` to the model, and the early-return prevented transcription from ever running. Now the empty-content message properly unblocks OpenCode's question waiter and flows through normal transcription, arriving as the next user message after the model responds.

## 0.4.85

1. **Fixed infinite reconnect loop after gateway proxy restart** — after a failed RESUME, the proxy now sends an `INVALID_SESSION` payload and properly drains the WebSocket sink before teardown, so the client reconnects cleanly instead of looping indefinitely.

2. **Fixed `ClientReady` errors crashing the bot silently** — unhandled rejections thrown inside the `ClientReady` handler are now caught and logged instead of taking down the process.

3. **Fixed slash commands being mirrored by external sync** — slash commands like `/errore-skill` dispatched from Discord were missing the `<discord-user />` origin tag (because `session.command()` doesn't accept synthetic text parts), causing external sync to treat them as external messages and mirror them as `» user: …`. The tag is now appended to command arguments so origin detection works correctly.

4. **Fixed Discord origin detection in command-argument text** — the origin metadata parser previously only matched the tag when it was the entire string (anchored `^…$`) and only looked in synthetic text parts. It now matches the tag anywhere in text and checks all text parts (synthetic first, non-synthetic as fallback).

## 0.4.84

1. **New `--projects-dir` flag** — set a custom directory where new projects are created:
   ```bash
   kimaki --projects-dir ~/my-projects
   ```
   Defaults to `<data-dir>/projects` if not set. The directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist.

2. **`kimaki tunnel --kill` flag** — kill any existing process on the port before starting the tunnel:
   ```bash
   kimaki tunnel --kill
   kimaki tunnel -k
   ```
   All tunnel usage examples in the system message and onboarding tutorial now include `--kill` so agents always free stale ports automatically.

3. **Screenshare links are now private by default** — `/screenshare` replies ephemerally, the default lifetime is 30 minutes, and tunnel IDs use 128-bit random values so leaked hosts are much harder to guess.

4. **Fixed queued messages getting stuck after question dropdown answered** — when a user answered a pending question via the Discord select menu, queued messages could stay stranded indefinitely. Queued items are now handed off to OpenCode immediately after the question reply instead of waiting for a separate idle event.

5. **Fixed external sync treating kimaki-initiated sessions as external** — the external sync poller was mirroring sessions owned by kimaki itself, creating duplicate `Sync:` threads. Detection now uses a pure event-based check (presence of `<discord-user />` in the latest user message) instead of a DB lookup, so it's accurate even when the DB entry hasn't been written yet.

6. **Fixed external sync missing Discord origin when message-id is absent** — bot-initiated threads weren't passing `sourceMessageId` to the ingress path, causing the origin parser to return null and mistakenly mirror those turns as `» user: hi`. Both the parser and the ingress call are now fixed.

7. **Fixed gateway reconnection crashes** — the forced gateway relogin mechanism was interfering with discord.js's own exponential-backoff reconnect logic, causing uncaught exceptions on handshake timeouts that killed the process. discord.js reconnection now handles recovery on its own.

## 0.4.83

1. **External OpenCode session sync** — kimaki now mirrors OpenCode sessions started outside Discord (e.g. from the CLI or another editor) into tracked Discord project threads automatically. Sessions are polled every 5 seconds, a new thread is created prefixed with `Sync:`, and messages stream in just like a normal kimaki session. Typing indicators show while the external session is busy.

2. **Two-way external sync** — replies sent in the synced Discord thread are forwarded back into the external OpenCode session. If you switch back to the CLI to continue a conversation, kimaki detects the new CLI-originated messages and re-claims the thread so sync keeps flowing.

3. **Live voice sessions switched to Gemini 2.0 Flash Live** — Discord voice sessions now use Google's latest lower-latency live audio model for faster, more natural conversations.

4. **Fixed scheduled thread prompts not triggering** — tasks scheduled against an existing thread were posted as bot messages that the bot's own-message guard was silently ignoring. Scheduled tasks now use the canonical start-marker path so they fire correctly.

5. **Fixed abort race before next message** — when a user sent a new message while a permission prompt was pending, the abort was fire-and-forget and the new message could race with the dying run. The abort now waits for `session.idle` (up to 2s) before the next message is enqueued.

6. **Suppressed notifications for intermediate queue steps** — permission prompts, question dropdowns, and footer messages now send silently when the thread queue has pending items. Only the final message in a queue notifies the user.

7. **SQLite cleanup on channel deletion** — deleting a Discord channel now removes all orphan rows (`channel_directories` and children) from the local SQLite database. `kimaki project list` no longer shows ghost entries, and a new `--prune` flag removes any remaining stale entries.

8. **Fixed OpenCode server restart on bot shutdown** — SIGINT was not suppressing the auto-restart loop, causing orphan OpenCode server processes to spawn after the bot exited. Both SIGINT and the `shuttingDown` flag now correctly suppress restarts.

## 0.4.82

1. **`/restart-opencode-server` now re-registers slash commands** — after restarting the OpenCode server, kimaki immediately re-registers all Discord slash commands (built-in + user commands + agents). New or changed commands, agents, and plugins are picked up without a full bot restart.
2. **Buttons and dropdowns stay alive for 24 hours** — permission prompts, question dropdowns, and file upload dialogs previously expired after 5 minutes (IPC stale TTL) and thread runtimes were disposed after 1 hour. Both are now 24 hours, so users who return the next day can still click pending buttons and selects.

## 0.4.81

1. **Fixed bot ignoring worktree and bot-created threads** — threads created by `/new-worktree`, `/fork`, or `kimaki send` were silently ignored because the thread guard (GitHub #84) checked for a non-empty session ID in the DB, but `createPendingWorktree` writes an empty `session_id`. The bot now also checks `thread.ownerId` — if the bot created the thread, it always responds.
2. **New `/memory-snapshot` command** — write a V8 heap snapshot to disk on demand for debugging memory issues. The snapshot is saved to `~/.kimaki/heap-snapshots/`.
3. **Fixed Anthropic OAuth token exchange race** — moved OAuth token exchange and refresh to an isolated Node helper to avoid 429 rate-limit responses and duplicate token exchanges when the browser callback lands.
4. **Fixed OOM from unbounded `session.diff` event strings** — `session.diff` events carrying large patch payloads are now dropped from the event buffer, and all buffered event strings are recursively pruned to a safe max length.

## 0.4.80

1. **Built-in Anthropic OAuth authentication** — the Anthropic OAuth plugin now ships with kimaki and loads automatically. No need to manage a separate plugin file in `~/.config/opencode/plugins/`. Log in with `/login` → Anthropic → OAuth and kimaki handles the PKCE flow, token refresh, and Claude Code request rewriting.

2. **New `kimaki task edit` CLI command** — edit the prompt and/or schedule of a planned task without deleting and recreating it:
   ```bash
   kimaki task edit <id> --prompt "Updated task description"
   kimaki task edit <id> --send-at "tomorrow at 9am"
   kimaki task edit <id> --prompt "New prompt" --send-at "every day at 8am"
   ```
   Only works on tasks in `planned` state.

3. **New `kimaki session discord-url` CLI command** — print the Discord thread URL for a given OpenCode session ID:
   ```bash
   kimaki session discord-url <session-id>
   kimaki session discord-url <session-id> --json
   ```
   `--json` returns `{ url, threadId, guildId, sessionId, threadName }` for scripting.

4. **Paginated select menus for `/model` and `/login`** — Discord caps select menus at 25 options, silently dropping anything beyond that. Providers like OpenRouter expose 162+ models, making many unreachable. Select menus now paginate with "← Previous page" / "Next page →" navigation so all providers and models are accessible.

5. **Fixed `/redo` to step forward one message at a time** — previously `/redo` jumped all the way back to the latest state in one shot. It now matches OpenCode TUI behavior: each `/redo` moves one user message forward (symmetric with `/undo`), so 3 undos require 3 redos to fully restore.

6. **Fixed OOM crash during long sessions** — assistant `message.updated` events were passing through the event buffer uncompacted, each carrying the full cumulative parts array (all tool outputs and text). With 1000 buffer entries, memory could exceed 4GB and trigger a V8 OOM kill. The buffer now strips `parts`, `system`, `summary`, and `tools` from all message events, keeping only the lightweight metadata needed for derivation.

7. **Fixed voice attachment detection and empty prompt guard** — improved detection handles cases where Discord omits `contentType` on uploaded audio files (checks duration, waveform, and file extension as fallbacks). Added a guard to skip sending empty prompts when voice transcription fails or produces no text.

8. **Fixed prompt.md wrapping in Discord file preview** — long-line prompts sent as file attachments are now word-wrapped at 120 chars before upload, so Discord's file viewer renders them readably instead of requiring horizontal scrolling.

9. **Fixed `/undo` and `/redo` error handling** — SDK errors on `session.get` and `session.messages` calls now bail early with the error message instead of silently proceeding with wrong behavior.

## 0.4.79

1. **New `/tasks` command** — list and cancel scheduled tasks created with `kimaki send --send-at`:
   ```
   /tasks        — show active scheduled tasks with Cancel buttons
   /tasks --all  — include completed and failed tasks
   ```
   Each row shows the task's schedule, next run time, status, and a Cancel button for active tasks.

2. **New `--permission` flag for `kimaki send`** — restrict which tools an OpenCode session can use on a per-send basis:
   ```bash
   kimaki send "Fix the bug" --permission "bash:deny"
   kimaki send "Review only" --permission "edit:deny" --permission "write:deny"
   kimaki send "Run tests"   --permission "bash:git *:allow"
   ```
   Format is `tool:action` or `tool:pattern:action`. Rules are appended after base permissions so they take priority.

3. **Fixed `/undo`** — now correctly aligns with OpenCode's TUI behavior. Passes the last user message ID (not the assistant message ID) to `session.revert()`, and removes manual message deletion — cleanup happens automatically on the next prompt.

4. **Fixed error replies now trigger Discord notifications** — error messages from failed sessions, permission denials, and voice errors were using silent flags and easy to miss. They now send proper Discord notifications.

5. **Fixed bot responding to non-kimaki threads** — the bot was processing all threads in configured project channels, including user-created threads with nothing to do with kimaki. It now ignores threads that don't have an existing session unless explicitly @mentioned.

6. **Fixed `/login` code-mode OAuth** — when a provider returns `method="code"` (e.g. SSH-based flows), a "Paste authorization code" button now appears so users can complete the flow. Previously the context was deleted immediately, making code mode a dead end.

7. **Fixed queue messages not dispatching when action buttons are shown** — queued messages now dispatch immediately when the session becomes idle, even if action buttons are still visible. Previously the queue was blocked unnecessarily while buttons were on screen.

8. **Fixed cron task timezone** — cron schedules (e.g. `0 10 * * *`) are now always evaluated in UTC, matching what the system message tells the model. Previously they fired at the machine's local time, which was wrong when the server is in a different timezone.

9. **Startup time ~40% faster** — three optimizations reduce time-to-ready: OpenCode health poll interval dropped from 1000ms to 100ms, the OpenCode server now starts earlier (overlapping with Discord login), and `which opencode` / `which bun` checks run in parallel.

10. **Fixed `/login` error messages and stale context cleanup** — consistent error parsing across all login steps, and pending login contexts are now cleaned up on failure instead of lingering until TTL.

## 0.4.78

1. **New `/screenshare` command** — share your screen via noVNC directly in the browser. Works on macOS (uses built-in Remote Management) and Linux (spawns x11vnc):
   ```
   /screenshare        — start screen sharing, bot replies with a noVNC URL
   /screenshare-stop   — stop the active session
   ```
   Also available as `kimaki screenshare` from the CLI (runs until Ctrl+C). Sessions auto-stop after 1 hour. One active session allowed per guild. The in-process websockify bridge replaces the Python websockify dependency — no extra installs needed.

2. **Fixed plugin part IDs failing OpenCode validation** — OpenCode requires all part IDs to start with `prt_`. The plugin hooks (MEMORY.md injection, time-gap notice, memory save reminder, git branch injection, onboarding tutorial) were generating bare UUIDs, causing a ZodError at runtime. All five are now correctly prefixed.

3. **Fixed screenshare tunnel not cleaning up on connect failure** — if the tunnel failed to connect or timed out, the `TunnelClient` kept trying to reconnect in the background. It is now explicitly closed on error so no orphaned reconnect loops are left running.

4. **Fixed screenshare startup on Linux** — replaced a blind 1-second sleep after spawning x11vnc with a port-readiness poll (100ms interval, 3s max). The startup now fails immediately if x11vnc exits early instead of hanging.

## 0.4.77

1. **Fixed session hang after dismissing permission prompts** — when a user sent a new message while a permission prompt was blocking a previous run, the blocked run would hang indefinitely. Now pending permission requests are rejected immediately when a new message arrives, so the follow-up can proceed without waiting.

2. **`kimaki` available as a direct command inside OpenCode sessions** — agents can now call `kimaki` directly (without `npx` or `bunx`) inside OpenCode sessions. A small cross-platform shim is injected into the server PATH so `kimaki session archive`, `kimaki user list`, etc. work the same way regardless of whether kimaki was launched via a global install, npm, pnpm, or a transient npx/bunx invocation.

3. **Fixed selected model lost after interrupt/resume** — when a session was interrupted mid-run (e.g. via `/model` switch) and then resumed, the resumed run fell back to the default model instead of the user's selection. The interrupt plugin now captures and carries the chosen agent/model into the resume call.

4. **Fixed Windows opencode startup** — `where opencode` output is now normalized before picking a binary so Windows installs prefer npm shim paths over raw non-executable entries or multiline `OPENCODE_PATH` values. `.cmd` launches are routed through `cmd.exe` with `windowsVerbatimArguments` for correct argument quoting on Windows.

5. **Fixed voice message transcription for m4a/mp4 audio** — audio MIME values including m4a aliases are now normalized before provider handling. m4a files are transcoded to WAV via ffmpeg for OpenAI `input_audio` compatibility, while OGG/Opus conversion continues on its own path.

6. **Fixed opencode `tool-output` directory access** — the `tool-output` directory (used by opencode for file outputs) is now allowed by default so agents can write outputs without hitting permission errors.

## 0.4.76

1. **SSE wire format for programmatic gateway events** — `kimaki --gateway` in headless/non-TTY mode now emits events using the SSE wire format (`data: {...}\n\n`) instead of bare JSON lines. This lets consumers use the `eventsource-parser` npm package to reliably extract events even when log noise, warnings, or spinner output is interleaved on stdout:
   ```ts
   import { createParser } from 'eventsource-parser'
   const parser = createParser((event) => {
     if (event.type === 'event') {
       const e = JSON.parse(event.data) // ProgrammaticEvent
     }
   })
   // pipe kimaki stdout chunks into parser.feed(chunk)
   ```
   The event shape is unchanged (`install_url`, `authorized`, `ready`, `error`).

2. **Default channel and welcome message created in headless mode** — when spawning `kimaki --gateway` programmatically (non-TTY), the default `#kimaki` channel and onboarding welcome thread are now created automatically after the bot connects, matching what the interactive setup flow does.

3. **Fixed gateway `--gateway-callback-url` redirect** — the `--gateway-callback-url` CLI option was silently ignored: the OAuth callback hook returned a double-wrapped response object instead of a `302 Response`, so users always landed on `/install-success` regardless of the custom URL.

4. **Fixed question tool duplicate prompt on text answer** — when the model used the question tool and the user replied with a plain text message instead of using the dropdown, the message was sent both as a question answer and as a new prompt, causing repeated abort/retry cycles. Text answers now skip the re-enqueue path.

5. **Fixed question tool TTL expiry behavior** — when the 10-minute timeout expired on a pending question, the bot was sending `['Other']` as a fake answer — causing the model to act on a choice the user never made. On expiry it now aborts the session silently without faking a selection.

6. **Fixed race between question dropdown click and session abort** — deleting the pending question context before calling `session.abort()` prevents a late dropdown click during the async abort from being accepted and then immediately killed.

7. **More punctuation supported in `. queue` suffix** — `!`, `?`, `,`, `;`, `:` are now accepted before `queue` in addition to `.`, and a trailing period is optional. Patterns like `Fix the bug! queue` or `Do this? queue.` now work.

## 0.4.75

1. **Default Kimaki channel created on onboarding** — a `kimaki-{botName}` channel (or `kimaki` in gateway mode) is now automatically created in the Kimaki category for general-purpose tasks. It's not tied to a project — the backing directory is `~/.kimaki/projects/kimaki`, initialized with git. Idempotent: skipped if the channel already exists.

2. **Welcome message and onboarding tutorial** — the default channel gets a welcome message on first creation explaining what Kimaki is. Sending your first message triggers a built-in tutorial that guides you through building a 3D Space Dodge game with Three.js + kimaki tunnel.

3. **Non-TTY gateway mode with JSON event protocol** — `kimaki --gateway` now works in headless environments (cloud sandboxes, CI, Docker). Instead of interactive prompts, it emits structured JSON lines:
   ```json
   {"type":"install_url","url":"..."}
   {"type":"authorized","guild_id":"..."}
   {"type":"ready","app_id":"...","guild_ids":[...]}
   {"type":"error","message":"..."}
   ```
   This makes it easy to script gateway onboarding without a terminal.

4. **`kimaki bot` command group** — new CLI subcommands to manage bot presence:
   ```bash
   # set bot status
   kimaki bot status set "Working on your code" --type playing --status online

   # clear bot status
   kimaki bot status clear

   # print bot install URL
   kimaki bot install-url
   ```
   Note: status commands are blocked in gateway mode since presence is global (shared bot).

5. **`/model-variant` command** — quickly switch the thinking level for the current model without going through the full `/model` menu. Shows variant and scope pickers in a single reply.

6. **`/mcp` command** — list and toggle MCP servers for the current project:
   - Shows all configured MCP servers with their status (connected/disconnected/error)
   - Select a server from the dropdown to connect or disconnect it

7. **`. queue` suffix support** — append `. queue` to any regular text message to queue it for after the current session finishes, same as the `/queue` command:
   ```
   Fix the login bug. queue
   ```

8. **Queue drains after session errors** — messages stuck in the local queue are now dispatched even if the session ended with an error, preventing stuck voice transcriptions.

9. **Worktree action buttons in `/worktrees` table** — delete buttons now appear directly in the worktrees table rows. Force-remove works even when the worktree folder contains submodules. Base and target branch autocomplete added to worktree commands.

10. **Footer anchored to assistant completion** — the run footer (`kimakivoice ⋅ main ⋅ 2m 30s ⋅ 71% ⋅ ...`) is now sent immediately after the last text part instead of being delayed, preventing spurious footers from appearing after interruptions.

11. **Runtimes reconnect after shared server restart** — `/restart-opencode-server` now properly reconnects all active thread runtimes after the server comes back up.

12. **Common directories pre-allowed for permissions** — system paths like `~/.npm`, `~/.cargo`, `/tmp`, and similar build caches are automatically allowed at the guild level, reducing permission prompts for common tool operations.

13. **Voice `[inaudible audio]` for incomprehensible input** — very short or inaudible voice messages now return `[inaudible audio]` instead of triggering a transcription error.

14. **`--gateway-callback-url` CLI option** — customize the OAuth redirect URL after bot authorization, useful for self-hosted website deployments.

15. **Memory leak fixes** — comprehensive cleanup of runtime and pending-UI state when sessions end, preventing accumulation of stale state across long-running bot processes.

## 0.4.74

1. **`kimaki session archive` and `kimaki user list` CLI commands** — Discord REST operations previously done by plugin tools (`kimaki_archive_thread`, `kimaki_list_discord_users`) are now proper CLI subcommands. The plugin tools were silently broken in gateway mode because they had no way to route requests through the proxy:
   ```bash
   # archive a thread by session ID
   kimaki session archive --session ses_abc123
   # list Discord users in the guild (with optional search)
   kimaki user list --guild 123456789 --query alice
   ```
   `kimaki_mark_thread` was removed (unused). The plugin no longer receives `KIMAKI_BOT_TOKEN`, eliminating the credential leak into child processes.

2. **Fixed `kimaki send` failing with 401 in gateway mode** — `resolveBotCredentials` now reads from the database first (which correctly sets the gateway proxy URL), falling back to the `KIMAKI_BOT_TOKEN` env var only for headless/CI deployments. Previously, subcommands always sent credentials directly to discord.com instead of through the proxy.

3. **Fixed bot mode selection for subcommands** — `send`, `project list`, `upload-to-discord` and other short-lived subcommands now correctly detect whether gateway or self-hosted mode is active. The fix uses a persistent `last_used_at` timestamp on the bot token row that the main bot stamps at startup, giving cross-process subcommands a reliable source of truth without any in-memory flags.

4. **Fixed queued message interrupt timing** — queued follow-up messages now abort as soon as the current assistant turn hits a blocking step-finish, instead of waiting for a hard timeout. The interrupt plugin also correctly waits for the aborted assistant message to propagate before resuming, preventing race conditions where resume could fire before abort was fully settled.

5. **Fixed empty resume messages appearing as queued work** — the interrupt plugin's internal `promptAsync({ parts: [] })` resume calls are no longer mistakenly tracked as pending user messages.

6. **Worktree creation more resilient to broken submodule configs** — partially-removed submodules (deleted from the tree but still referenced in `.gitmodules`) no longer block worktree creation; the error is logged as a warning and the worktree is returned normally.

7. **`/worktrees` capped at 10 entries** — keeps the ephemeral response compact when many worktree sessions have accumulated.

## 0.4.73

1. **New `/worktrees` slash command** — list all active worktree sessions with branch, status, and age; handles deleted worktree folders gracefully
2. **New `/stop-opencode-server` command** — manually stop the OpenCode server for the current project channel
3. **OpenCode servers auto-stop after 2 hours of inactivity** — idle server processes are cleaned up automatically to free resources
4. **Agent name shown in thread messages** — messages now prefix with the active agent name (e.g. `[build-agent]`) instead of the generic `task` label
5. **Tool calls from previous sessions hidden** — resuming a session no longer replays tool call messages from earlier runs in the thread
6. **Stale action buttons cleaned up** — action buttons left over from ended sessions are properly removed
7. **Legacy global slash commands removed on startup** — outdated global commands are automatically cleaned up when the bot registers guild commands
8. **`--gateway` CLI flag** — force gateway mode even when self-hosted credentials are already saved, useful for switching between modes
9. **`/login` providers sorted by popularity** — most-used providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) are listed first
10. **`/verbosity` uses a dropdown** — replaced text input with a select menu for a better UX when setting output verbosity
11. **Fixed duplicate context usage notices** — context percentage no longer appears twice before the run footer
12. **Fixed queued message delivery timing** — queued messages now wait for the current run to fully complete before dispatching
13. **Bot explains unlinked channels** — when `@mentioned` in a channel not linked to a project, the bot now sends a helpful explanation
14. **Fixed typing indicator stuck after `/abort`** — typing indicator now properly clears when aborting a session
15. **Fixed interrupt messages showing `»` prefix** — messages after an abort no longer show the queue indicator prefix
16. **`/queue` confirmation delayed until dispatched** — queue echo is shown only after the message is actually placed in the queue
17. **Voice messages show queue position** — queued voice messages now display their queue position number
18. **`~/.kimaki` always accessible** — OpenCode sessions no longer trigger permission prompts when reading kimaki config files
19. **Smart bot auto-selection** — picks the correct bot configuration automatically when multiple bots are configured in the database
20. **`--restart-onboarding` flag renamed from `--restart`** — more descriptive name for the flag that re-runs the setup wizard

## 0.4.72

1. **Fixed plugin tools silently missing** — `kimaki_action_buttons`, `kimaki_file_upload`, `kimaki_mark_thread`, and other plugin tools were silently missing on some OpenCode versions due to a crash in the plugin loader; the root cause (an extra exported function confusing the loader) is now fixed
2. **Voice "queue this message" intent** — say "queue this message" (or similar) in a voice note while the AI is working and the message is queued instead of interrupting the current session
3. **Voice reliability fixes** — three race conditions fixed: active-session state is now snapshotted at message arrival so voice messages queue correctly even if the previous task finishes during transcription; transcription failures no longer send empty prompts; the "queued" label is only shown after the actual queuing decision
4. **Log file now at `~/.kimaki/kimaki.log`** — logs are written in all environments (was only written in dev mode before); the AI model is also told where to find the file for self-diagnosis
5. **Secrets scrubbed from logs and error reports** — API keys, Bearer tokens, and other credentials are now redacted from log output and Sentry payloads; non-sensitive identifiers like Discord IDs and channel names are preserved for debugging
6. **Fixed Discord permission checks for uncached members** — member role/permission lookups now handle both cached class instances and raw API payload shapes, fixing permission errors for users whose data wasn't in the bot's cache (thanks @ajoslin in #57)
7. **Fixed atomic worktree database writes** — worktree state is now written atomically to prevent rare race conditions (thanks @ajoslin in #58)
8. **New built-in skills: `simplify`, `batch`, `security-review`** — three skills extracted from Claude Code CLI are now available to the AI agent in every Kimaki session

## 0.4.71

1. **Fixed package.json dependency classification** — `opencode-deterministic-provider` moved from `dependencies` to `devDependencies` so it no longer appears as a runtime dependency in the published package

## 0.4.70

1. **Immediate interrupt handling** — sending a new message while the AI is working now aborts the running session at the next step boundary, so your follow-up is processed right away instead of waiting for the full response to finish
2. **Memory simplified to `MEMORY.md`** — the `--memory` flag and Discord forum-based memory infrastructure are removed; the agent now reads and updates a `MEMORY.md` file in your project root automatically, with no flags or setup required
3. **Agent descriptions in system prompt** — all configured agents and their descriptions are now injected into the session context so the AI can make smarter agent selection decisions
4. **Slash command name fixes** — user-defined commands containing slashes, colons, or other special characters now register and route correctly in Discord
5. **Voice transcription reliability** — voice messages are now processed in the correct order; the transcription model no longer accidentally answers user questions; stale transcriptions from previous sessions are no longer reused
6. **Worktree creation fixes** — worktree creation no longer fails due to broken dependency install steps (`ni` and `--frozen-lockfile` removed)
7. **Fork dropdown filtering** — the `/fork` message picker no longer shows internal synthetic messages, only real user and assistant turns
8. **Large tool output truncation** — tool call outputs exceeding 30k characters are truncated to prevent context window overflow during session reads
9. **Permission prompt suppression** — the agent no longer triggers permission prompts when accessing `MEMORY.md` and other config paths

## 0.4.69

### Patch Changes

- feat: **OpenAI voice transcription** — new `/transcription-key` command stores API key for voice message transcription; auto-detects provider from key prefix (`sk-*` → OpenAI, otherwise Gemini)
- feat: **`gpt-4o-audio-preview` transcription model** — uses the chat completions API with OGG-to-WAV conversion for high-quality voice-to-text; falls back gracefully on decode errors
- feat: **in-process Hrana v2 server** — replaces the 39 MB `sqld` Rust binary with a lightweight Node.js HTTP server speaking the [Hrana v2 protocol](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql/blob/main/docs/HTTP_V2_SPEC.md), backed by `libsql`; eliminates a large binary dependency and startup overhead
  ```
  Before: sqld child process (39 MB Rust binary)
  After:  in-process HTTP server on the lock port — same Prisma adapter, no separate process
  ```
- feat: **bot-to-bot sessions** — bots with the Kimaki role can now trigger OpenCode sessions; a self-message guard prevents infinite loops when the bot also has the Kimaki role

- feat: **auto-derive App ID from bot token** — no interactive prompt needed; when `KIMAKI_BOT_TOKEN` is set the App ID is extracted automatically
- feat: **thread ID in system prompt** — `threadId` is now injected into the OpenCode system prompt so agents can reference the current Discord thread for scheduling reminders (`--send-at`)
- feat: **termcast skill** — new built-in skill for building Raycast-style TUIs with React in the terminal via `termcast`/`opentui`
- feat: **memory forum auto-tags** — project tags are created automatically on the memory forum channel; embeds are suppressed in forum messages for cleaner appearance
- fix: **remove `/upgrade-and-restart` command** — the command caused confusion and is no longer needed (fixes #49)
- fix: **`/login` and `/model` dropdowns sorted** — provider and model options are now sorted alphabetically for easier scanning
- fix: **archive thread delay** — increased from 5 s to 10 s so the final bot message is readable before the thread hides from the sidebar
- fix: **project channel footer** — footer now survives the Discord 2000-char limit and falls back gracefully on empty body
- fix: **test isolation** — vitest runs now auto-isolate from the real `~/.kimaki/` database via `KIMAKI_VITEST` env var injected by `vitest.config.ts`
- fix: **`waitForServer` simplified** — all scripts now poll only `/api/health` (matching `opencode.ts`) and use `127.0.0.1` to avoid DNS/IPv6 ambiguity

- fix: **interactive UI echo** - prevent user messages from being echoed back when flushing interactive UI state
- fix: **duplicate part output** - prevent duplicate part output on interrupted/replayed runs
- fix: **send-at UTC format** - require explicit UTC date format for scheduled task timestamps
- fix: **startup timeout errors** - include opencode stderr tail in startup timeout error messages for easier debugging
- perf: **non-blocking quick-start** - bot startup is now non-blocking so the ready message appears faster

## 0.4.67

### Patch Changes
